# Unique Selling Proposition

After finishing this you should have a USP (unique value proposition) that differentiates you from your competitors and you can use to market your product to the right audience.

Your unique factor directly relates to the type of clients you will land and who your customers are
What makes you - you
How would you act with no social pressure around you?

## Finding Your Voice

Your unique factor directly relates to the type of clients you will land and who your customers are
What makes you - you
How would you act with no social pressure around you?

To fin your voice ask yourself:

What angers you?
What makes you cry?
What have you mastered?
What gives you hope?
As a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?
If you had all the time and money in the world, what would you do?
What would blow your mind?
What platform do you own?
What change would you like to see in the world?
If you had one day left, how would you spend it?

## Differentiate Yourself

It’s your job to assist them by making your unique selling proposition obvious, different and memorable enough that they can see exactly what your business has to offer that possible competitors do not.

It does not have to be about the product or service. It can be purely the vision.

## Purpose Driven Entrepreneurs

Who are you helping?

Charities?
Young organizations?
Building schools?
Building communities?
Health associations?
Inspiring the leaders of tomorrow?
Spitual?

## Don’t Spend Your Time Convincing People

You’re not trying to convince people

You’re to live by example

Put this lifestyle into your unique selling proposition

# Golden Cycle Framework

### Overview

**The Golden Circle Framework:** Great leaders and organizations think, act, and communicate differently from everyone else. While most people communicate from the outside in (What → How → Why), inspiring leaders start from the inside out (Why → How → What). Every organization knows what they do, some know how they do it, but very few know why they do it - their purpose, cause, or belief. This "why" isn't about making profit (that's a result), but about the deeper purpose that drives the organization.
**The Power of Starting with Why:** Apple exemplifies this approach. Instead of saying "We make great computers that are beautifully designed" (what/how), they communicate "We believe in challenging the status quo and thinking differently. We happen to make great computers." This explains why people buy diverse Apple products - they're not buying the product, they're buying the belief. The concept is rooted in biology: our limbic brain controls decision-making and emotions but has no capacity for language, while our neocortex processes rational information. When we communicate from the inside out, we speak directly to the decision-making part of the brain.
**Real-World Applications:** The Wright Brothers succeeded over the well-funded Samuel Langley because they were driven by a belief that powered flight would change the world, while Langley pursued fame and fortune. Similarly, Martin Luther King didn't have a plan - he had a dream and belief that inspired 250,000 people to show up in Washington. According to the law of diffusion of innovation, you need to reach the innovators and early adopters (who make gut decisions based on beliefs) before achieving mass market success.
**The Key Insight:** People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. The goal isn't to do business with everyone who needs what you have, but with people who believe what you believe. This creates loyalty, inspiration, and sustainable success because you're attracting those who share your values and vision.

### Details

**The Discovery of the Golden Circle:** Simon Sinek discovered a pattern that explains why some organizations and leaders inspire while others don't. All great inspiring leaders and organizations - whether Apple, Martin Luther King, or the Wright Brothers - think, act, and communicate in the exact same way, which is completely opposite to everyone else. This pattern, called the Golden Circle, consists of three simple questions: Why? How? What? While this seems like the world's simplest idea, it fundamentally explains the difference between those who inspire and those who don't.
**The Framework Explained:** Every single person and organization knows what they do (100%), some know how they do it (their differentiated value proposition, proprietary process, or USP), but very few people or organizations know why they do what they do. The "why" isn't about making profit - that's always a result. It's about purpose, cause, and belief: Why does your organization exist? Why do you get out of bed in the morning? Why should anyone care? Most people communicate from the outside in (clearest to fuzziest), but inspired leaders communicate from the inside out, starting with their core beliefs and working outward.
**Apple's Demonstration of the Principle:** If Apple communicated like everyone else, they might say: "We make great computers. They're beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly. Want to buy one?" The response would be "Meh." Instead, Apple actually communicates: "Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently. The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly. We just happen to make great computers. Want to buy one?" This reversal of information proves that people don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. This explains why people comfortably buy computers, MP3 players, phones, and DVRs from Apple, while nobody bought similar products from Gateway or Dell, despite these companies being equally qualified manufacturers.
**The Biological Foundation:** This concept isn't just psychology - it's grounded in biology. The human brain's structure correlates perfectly with the Golden Circle. Our neocortex (newest brain) corresponds to the "what" level and handles rational, analytical thought and language. The middle two sections (limbic brains) correspond to "how" and "why" and are responsible for feelings like trust and loyalty, all human behavior, and decision-making - but have no capacity for language. When we communicate from outside in, people understand complicated information but it doesn't drive behavior. When we communicate from inside out, we speak directly to the brain part that controls behavior, allowing people to rationalize with tangible things we say and do.
**Historical Examples:** Wright Brothers vs. Langley: The Wright Brothers story perfectly illustrates this principle. Samuel Pierpont Langley had everything we assume leads to success: $50,000 from the War Department, Harvard connections, Smithsonian position, the best minds money could buy, and fantastic market conditions with New York Times coverage. Yet we've never heard of him. Meanwhile, the Wright Brothers had no money (funded by bicycle shop proceeds), no college education, and no media attention. The difference: the Wright Brothers were driven by a cause and belief that if they figured out flying, it would change the world. Langley wanted to be rich and famous - he pursued results, not purpose. When the Wright Brothers achieved flight on December 17, 1903, Langley quit because he wasn't first, rich, or famous.
**The Law of Diffusion of Innovation:** Understanding why it's important to attract believers involves the law of diffusion of innovation. The population breaks down as: 2.5% innovators, 13.5% early adopters, 34% early majority, 34% late majority, and 16% laggards. For mass-market success, you must achieve 15-18% market penetration to reach the tipping point. The challenge is crossing the chasm between early adopters and early majority, because the early majority won't try something until someone else tries it first. Innovators and early adopters make gut decisions based on beliefs, not just available products - like standing six hours in line for the first iPhone or spending $40,000 on early flat-screen TVs, not because the technology was great, but because they wanted to be first.
**Success and Failure Examples:** TiVo represents a famous failure despite having the highest-quality product, excellent funding, and fantastic market conditions. They told people what they had: "We have a product that pauses live TV, skips commercials, rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits." The cynical majority responded: "We don't believe you. We don't need it. We don't like it. You're scaring us." Conversely, Martin Luther King's 1963 March on Washington succeeded because he didn't tell people what needed to change in America - he told them what he believed. 250,000 people showed up not for him, but for themselves and what they believed about America. He gave the "I have a dream" speech, not an "I have a plan" speech.
**The Ultimate Leadership Principle:** The fundamental insight is that people don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. The goal isn't selling to people who need what you have or hiring people who need jobs - it's finding people who believe what you believe. When you hire people who believe what you believe, they work with blood, sweat, and tears, not just for money. There are leaders who hold positions of power, and there are those who lead by inspiring us. We follow those who lead not because we have to, but because we want to - not for them, but for ourselves. Those who start with "why" have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them.
