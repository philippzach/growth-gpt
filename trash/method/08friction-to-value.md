# Friction-to-Value Canvas (FTV) (low or high)

How complex is the product for your customer to use? Do they easily get what you offer and what benefits your product can bring for them?

# Intent vs Discovery

Intent based is where people are actively looking for the solution of product that you offer. This is often where you get lots of traffic from intent based (advertising) channels such as SEA, SEO.

Discovery based is when people don't know they have the pain that you solve with your product or service. This is often where you get your traffic from discovery based (advertising) channels: Social Media Marketing, Youtube Ads, Organic Social Media Events, Events, TV, Influencer marketing.
