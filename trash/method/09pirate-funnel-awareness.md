## Finding New Customer Awareness Channels

Option A

We are going to find out where websites with similar audiences to ours get their traffic from. We can probably tap into some of the same channels to get traffic to our company's page.

1. Navigate to https://www.similarweb.com and use the website url of the top site with a similar audience (that you found in the persona task before)
2. Some of the most interesting Reports are the Traffic Sources, Referrals and Social reports. They answer the crucial question "What networks/platforms were people hanging out on before they came to this website? Start capturing any interesting findings.
3. At the bottom of the page you will see "similar sites", where you can find additional companies to build your channel list.
4. Run the same analysis on as many companies as it takes to find 3 new acquisition channels. Start to look for overlaps, trends, commonalities, ideas, patterns, irregularities. Are there any channels no-one is using? is everyone using search and no-one using Social? Are they getting a lot of traffic from a specific website? Is there a channel that everyone is using?

Option B

We are going to do a customer research to create the right content for what they are searching for.

1. Navigate to https://answerthepublic.com/
2. Research for your product or service in the desired language and geography location
3. Get top questions suggested by/searched on Google, bing, Tiktok, Youtube, Amazon and Instagram
4. Use the insights for Strategic content Marketing for audience engagement, Keyword analysis to improve online visibilty and boost rankings, consumer research to make informed decisions, targeted paid media advertising for results, stratetic communication for perception of your brand or service.
