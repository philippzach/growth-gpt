#### Important Notes

GTM research should validate or invalidate specific hypotheses, not explore broadly
Customer behavior data trumps customer opinion data
Competitive positioning requires both differentiation AND relevance
Business model validation must include willingness to pay, not just interest
Problem-solution fit is prerequisite to product-market fit
Document why customers DON'T buy, not just why they do
Test channels where customers naturally seek solutions
Validate the entire business model, not just the product

This adaptation focuses the research prompt creation specifically on GTM strategy validation, incorporating all the key frameworks (Value Proposition Canvas, Problem-Solution Fit, USP, and Business Model Canvas) while maintaining a structured approach to generating actionable research plans.
