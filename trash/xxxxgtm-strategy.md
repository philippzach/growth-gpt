# Facilitate GTM Strategy Brainstorming Session

Facilitate interactive brainstorming sessions focused on go-to-market strategy, value proposition development, and problem-solution fit validation.

## Process

### Step 1: Session Setup

Ask 4 context questions (don't preview what happens next):

1. What aspect of your go-to-market strategy are we exploring? (e.g., value proposition, customer segments, unique selling proposition, business model)
2. What's your current business stage? (idea, MVP, existing product needing repositioning)
3. Who is your target customer, if known?
4. Do you want a structured GTM strategy document output? (Default Yes)

### Step 2: Present Approach Options

After getting answers to Step 1, present 6 approach options (numbered):

1. **Value Proposition Design** - Use Value Proposition Canvas to map customer jobs, pains, and gains
2. **Problem-Solution Fit** - Validate problems worth solving using Problem-Solution Fit Canvas
3. **USP Development** - Craft your unique selling proposition and differentiation
4. **Business Model Innovation** - Explore all 9 building blocks of your business model
5. **Customer Discovery** - Deep dive into customer segments and their behaviors
6. **Comprehensive GTM Flow** - Progress through multiple frameworks systematically

### Step 3: Execute Frameworks Interactively

**KEY PRINCIPLES:**

- **FACILITATOR ROLE**: Guide user through framework questions to uncover their own insights
- **CUSTOMER-CENTRIC FOCUS**: Always bring discussion back to customer needs and behaviors
- **CONTINUOUS VALIDATION**: Challenge assumptions and dig for root causes
- **CAPTURE INSIGHTS**: Document all discoveries in structured format from the beginning

**Framework Execution:**

For each selected approach, use these facilitation patterns:

**Value Proposition Canvas:**

- Start with Customer Profile (jobs, pains, gains)
- Then move to Value Map (products, pain relievers, gain creators)
- Ask probing questions: "What keeps your customer awake at night?"

**Problem-Solution Fit Canvas:**

- Begin with problem frequency: "How often does this problem occur?"
- Explore customer state limitations and available alternatives
- Map behavior patterns: "What do customers currently do about this?"

**USP Development:**

- Use "Finding Your Voice" questions to uncover authentic differentiation
- Challenge: "What makes you angry about current solutions?"
- Build purpose-driven positioning

**Business Model Canvas:**

- Start with Value Proposition and Customer Segments
- Work outward to channels, relationships, revenue streams
- Always validate cost structure against revenue potential

### Step 4: Session Flow

1. **Discovery** (10-15 min) - Understand current state and assumptions
2. **Exploration** (20-30 min) - Deep dive using selected frameworks
3. **Validation** (15-20 min) - Challenge assumptions and test fit
4. **Synthesis** (10-15 min) - Crystallize key insights and next steps

### Step 5: GTM Strategy Document Output (if requested)

Generate structured document with these sections:

**Executive Summary**

- Business concept and vision
- Target customer definition
- Core value proposition
- Unique selling proposition
- Key strategic recommendations

**Customer Analysis**

- **Customer Segments**: Detailed personas and characteristics
- **Jobs to be Done**: Functional, social, and emotional jobs
- **Pains & Gains**: Prioritized by frequency and intensity
- **Current Behavior**: How they solve problems today
- **State Limitations**: Constraints affecting adoption

**Value Proposition Design**

- **Core Offering**: Products/services that address jobs
- **Pain Relievers**: How you eliminate customer frustrations
- **Gain Creators**: How you create desired outcomes
- **Proof Points**: Evidence of value delivery

**Competitive Differentiation**

- **USP Statement**: Clear, memorable positioning
- **Competitive Analysis**: How you're different/better
- **Purpose & Vision**: Why you exist beyond profit
- **Brand Voice**: Authentic communication style

**Go-to-Market Strategy**

- **Channels**: Where to reach customers (online/offline)
- **Triggers**: What prompts customer action
- **Messaging**: Emotional hooks and rational benefits
- **Pricing Strategy**: Based on willingness to pay
- **Launch Sequence**: Phased approach to market entry

**Business Model Validation**

- **Revenue Streams**: Multiple monetization paths
- **Cost Structure**: Key costs and unit economics
- **Key Resources**: What's needed to deliver value
- **Key Activities**: Core processes to execute
- **Key Partnerships**: Strategic relationships needed

**Action Plan**

- **Immediate Next Steps**: 3-5 priority actions
- **Validation Experiments**: Tests to run with customers
- **Metrics & KPIs**: How to measure success
- **Timeline**: Key milestones and deadlines
- **Resources Needed**: Team, budget, tools

**Risk Analysis & Mitigation**

- **Assumptions to Test**: Critical unknowns
- **Potential Obstacles**: Market, technical, operational
- **Contingency Plans**: Alternative approaches

## Key Principles

- **CUSTOMER OBSESSION**: Every idea must tie back to solving real customer problems
- **PROBLEM-FIRST THINKING**: Validate the problem before jumping to solutions
- **BEHAVIORAL INSIGHTS**: Tap into existing behaviors rather than changing them
- **EMOTIONAL RESONANCE**: Connect with feelings, not just features
- **COMPETITIVE CLARITY**: Know exactly how you're different and why it matters
- **REVENUE FOCUS**: Always validate willingness to pay
- **ITERATIVE REFINEMENT**: Treat everything as a hypothesis to test

## Advanced Facilitation Strategies

**Digging Deeper**

- "Tell me more about why that matters to your customer..."
- "What's the root cause behind that problem?"
- "How do you know customers actually want this?"

**Challenging Assumptions**

- "What evidence do you have for that?"
- "What if the opposite were true?"
- "Who might NOT want this solution?"

**Making Connections**

- "How does this relate to your earlier point about...?"
- "What pattern are you noticing?"
- "How might this create a competitive moat?"

**Transition Management**

- "Should we validate this with the Problem-Solution Fit framework?"
- "Ready to explore how this becomes a business model?"
- "What questions need answering before we proceed?"
