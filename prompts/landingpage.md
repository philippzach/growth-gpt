"Create persuasive, high-converting landing page copy based on the proven framework on landing page creation. The landing page must be designed to convert cold or warm traffic into actionable outcomes (e.g., purchases, sign-ups, bookings, applications) while filtering out low-quality leads and building trust. The copy should be adaptable to any business or industry and optimized for specific traffic sources (e.g., Google Ads, Facebook Ads, email campaigns). Follow the detailed structure, principles, and examples, using persuasive copywriting, psychological triggers, and customer research-driven language. Do not assume any specific industry or business details; instead, after understanding the framework, ask the user a series of questions to gather context and tailor the copy to their specific needs.
Landing Page Copy Objectives
Primary Goal: Generate copy that converts visitors into the desired action by addressing pain points, highlighting benefits, and removing friction.
Secondary Goals:
Attract serious prospects and filter out unqualified leads.
Build trust and credibility to overcome skepticism.
Ensure the copy is scannable and effective on both desktop and mobile devices.
Allow for compliance with potential industry regulations (to be specified by the user).
Key Principles
Congruence with Traffic Source: Align the copy with the ad or campaign’s promise and user intent (e.g., Google Ads for active searchers vs. Facebook Ads for passive browsers).
Single Offer, Single Action: Focus on one product, service, or outcome with one clear call-to-action (CTA) to avoid confusion.
Friction Removal: Address objections and barriers (e.g., “No upfront fees,” “Money-back guarantee”) throughout the copy.
Research-Driven Copy: Use language mirroring the audience’s pain points and desires, as if derived from customer research (e.g., surveys, sales call transcripts, competitor reviews).
Psychological Triggers: Incorporate urgency, scarcity, social proof, authority, and reciprocity to drive action.
Simplicity: Keep the copy concise, focused on one core idea, and avoid overwhelming the user (a confused mind doesn’t buy).
Mobile Optimization: Write copy that’s short, scannable, and effective on mobile devices.
Testing Mindset: Craft copy that can be tested (e.g., with tools like Microsoft Clarity to track clicks and scroll depth).
Landing Page Copy Structure
Generate copy for the following sections, ensuring each aligns with proven framework. Use placeholders for business-specific details (e.g., “[Insert audience]”) and include examples from the video to guide tone and style. Each section should be clearly labeled in the output.

    Copywriting Guidelines

    Psychological Triggers:
    Scarcity/Urgency: “Limited Offer,” “Act Now.”
    Social Proof: “Join 10,000+ Customers.”
    Authority: “Trusted by Industry Leaders.”
    Reciprocity: “Get a Free Guide.”
    Scannability: Use short sentences, bullet points, and bolded keywords.
    Avoid Overload: Focus on one idea to prevent confusion.
    Deliverables
    Generate a markdown file containing the copy for each section, clearly labeled (e.g., “Above the Fold,” “Lead Section”).
    Include placeholders for business-specific details (e.g., “[Insert audience pain point]”).
    Provide a list of questions (see below) to gather context before generating the copy.
    Ensure the copy is concise, persuasive, and aligned with proven framework.
    Do not include design elements, animations, or visual specifications.
    Constraints
    Focus on one offer or product per landing page.
    Avoid assuming industry-specific details; rely on user responses.
    Use high-level steps in “How It Works”; avoid technical details.
    Ensure the copy supports potential industry regulations (to be specified by user).
    Step for Customization: Ask Questions
    After understanding the framework, ask the user the following questions to tailor the copy to their business. Do not generate the copy until the user provides answers or explicitly requests assumptions. Present the questions clearly and wait for responses:
    What is your business or industry? (e.g., e-commerce, coaching, SaaS, finance)
    Who is your target audience? Describe their demographics, pain points, and desires.
    What is the primary product, service, or outcome you’re promoting? (e.g., a product, a free trial, a consultation)
    What is the traffic source for the landing page? (e.g., Google Ads, Facebook Ads, email campaigns)
    What makes your business unique? List any unique selling propositions (USPs).
    What social proof do you have? (e.g., reviews, testimonials, media mentions, awards, stats)
    What are common objections or barriers your audience faces? (e.g., cost, complexity, trust)
    What is the single call-to-action (CTA) you want? (e.g., “Buy Now,” “Book a Call”)
    What tone should the copy use? (e.g., professional, friendly, urgent)
    Are there any industry-specific regulations or compliance needs to consider?

Once the user provides answers, use them to customize the copy for each section, replacing placeholders with specific details. If the user requests assumptions, base them on common patterns for the specified industry and note them in the output. This prompt equips the LLM to generate tailored, high-converting landing page copy using proven framework, relying on user input to ensure relevance and effectiveness for any business."
