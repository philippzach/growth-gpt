## Golden Cycle Framework

### Overview

**The Golden Circle Framework:** Great leaders and organizations think, act, and communicate differently from everyone else. While most people communicate from the outside in (What â†’ How â†’ Why), inspiring leaders start from the inside out (Why â†’ How â†’ What). Every organization knows what they do, some know how they do it, but very few know why they do it - their purpose, cause, or belief. This "why" isn't about making profit (that's a result), but about the deeper purpose that drives the organization.
**The Power of Starting with Why:** Apple exemplifies this approach. Instead of saying "We make great computers that are beautifully designed" (what/how), they communicate "We believe in challenging the status quo and thinking differently. We happen to make great computers." This explains why people buy diverse Apple products - they're not buying the product, they're buying the belief. The concept is rooted in biology: our limbic brain controls decision-making and emotions but has no capacity for language, while our neocortex processes rational information. When we communicate from the inside out, we speak directly to the decision-making part of the brain.
**Real-World Applications:** The Wright Brothers succeeded over the well-funded Samuel Langley because they were driven by a belief that powered flight would change the world, while Langley pursued fame and fortune. Similarly, Martin Luther King didn't have a plan - he had a dream and belief that inspired 250,000 people to show up in Washington. According to the law of diffusion of innovation, you need to reach the innovators and early adopters (who make gut decisions based on beliefs) before achieving mass market success.
**The Key Insight:** People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. The goal isn't to do business with everyone who needs what you have, but with people who believe what you believe. This creates loyalty, inspiration, and sustainable success because you're attracting those who share your values and vision.

### Details

**The Discovery of the Golden Circle:** Simon Sinek discovered a pattern that explains why some organizations and leaders inspire while others don't. All great inspiring leaders and organizations - whether Apple, Martin Luther King, or the Wright Brothers - think, act, and communicate in the exact same way, which is completely opposite to everyone else. This pattern, called the Golden Circle, consists of three simple questions: Why? How? What? While this seems like the world's simplest idea, it fundamentally explains the difference between those who inspire and those who don't.
**The Framework Explained:** Every single person and organization knows what they do (100%), some know how they do it (their differentiated value proposition, proprietary process, or USP), but very few people or organizations know why they do what they do. The "why" isn't about making profit - that's always a result. It's about purpose, cause, and belief: Why does your organization exist? Why do you get out of bed in the morning? Why should anyone care? Most people communicate from the outside in (clearest to fuzziest), but inspired leaders communicate from the inside out, starting with their core beliefs and working outward.
**Apple's Demonstration of the Principle:** If Apple communicated like everyone else, they might say: "We make great computers. They're beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly. Want to buy one?" The response would be "Meh." Instead, Apple actually communicates: "Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently. The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly. We just happen to make great computers. Want to buy one?" This reversal of information proves that people don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. This explains why people comfortably buy computers, MP3 players, phones, and DVRs from Apple, while nobody bought similar products from Gateway or Dell, despite these companies being equally qualified manufacturers.
**The Biological Foundation:** This concept isn't just psychology - it's grounded in biology. The human brain's structure correlates perfectly with the Golden Circle. Our neocortex (newest brain) corresponds to the "what" level and handles rational, analytical thought and language. The middle two sections (limbic brains) correspond to "how" and "why" and are responsible for feelings like trust and loyalty, all human behavior, and decision-making - but have no capacity for language. When we communicate from outside in, people understand complicated information but it doesn't drive behavior. When we communicate from inside out, we speak directly to the brain part that controls behavior, allowing people to rationalize with tangible things we say and do.
**Historical Examples:** Wright Brothers vs. Langley: The Wright Brothers story perfectly illustrates this principle. Samuel Pierpont Langley had everything we assume leads to success: $50,000 from the War Department, Harvard connections, Smithsonian position, the best minds money could buy, and fantastic market conditions with New York Times coverage. Yet we've never heard of him. Meanwhile, the Wright Brothers had no money (funded by bicycle shop proceeds), no college education, and no media attention. The difference: the Wright Brothers were driven by a cause and belief that if they figured out flying, it would change the world. Langley wanted to be rich and famous - he pursued results, not purpose. When the Wright Brothers achieved flight on December 17, 1903, Langley quit because he wasn't first, rich, or famous.
**The Law of Diffusion of Innovation:** Understanding why it's important to attract believers involves the law of diffusion of innovation. The population breaks down as: 2.5% innovators, 13.5% early adopters, 34% early majority, 34% late majority, and 16% laggards. For mass-market success, you must achieve 15-18% market penetration to reach the tipping point. The challenge is crossing the chasm between early adopters and early majority, because the early majority won't try something until someone else tries it first. Innovators and early adopters make gut decisions based on beliefs, not just available products - like standing six hours in line for the first iPhone or spending $40,000 on early flat-screen TVs, not because the technology was great, but because they wanted to be first.
**Success and Failure Examples:** TiVo represents a famous failure despite having the highest-quality product, excellent funding, and fantastic market conditions. They told people what they had: "We have a product that pauses live TV, skips commercials, rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits." The cynical majority responded: "We don't believe you. We don't need it. We don't like it. You're scaring us." Conversely, Martin Luther King's 1963 March on Washington succeeded because he didn't tell people what needed to change in America - he told them what he believed. 250,000 people showed up not for him, but for themselves and what they believed about America. He gave the "I have a dream" speech, not an "I have a plan" speech.
**The Ultimate Leadership Principle:** The fundamental insight is that people don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. The goal isn't selling to people who need what you have or hiring people who need jobs - it's finding people who believe what you believe. When you hire people who believe what you believe, they work with blood, sweat, and tears, not just for money. There are leaders who hold positions of power, and there are those who lead by inspiring us. We follow those who lead not because we have to, but because we want to - not for them, but for ourselves. Those who start with "why" have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them.

## 02PROBLEM-SOLUTION-FIT

# Problem Solution Fit Canvas

The Problem-Solution Fit canvas is based on the principles of Lean Startup, LUM (Lazy User Model) and User Experience design. It helps entrepreneurs, marketers and corporate innovators identify behavioral patterns and recognize what would work and why. It is a template to help identify solutions with higher chances of solution adoption, reduce time spent on testing and get a better overview of the current situation.

My goal was to create a tool that translates a problem into a solution, taking into account customer behavior and the context around it. None of the existing canvases or frameworks were giving me an overview and insight into the real customer situation during his/her decision-making process. With this template you will be able to take important information into consideration at an earlier stage and look at problem solving in depth. It increases your chances of finding problem-solution and product-market fit.

It helps you to:
Solve complex problems in a way that fits the state of your customers.
Succeed faster and increase your solution adoption by tapping into existing mediums and channels of behavior.
Sharpen your communication and marketing strategy with the right triggers and messaging.
Increase touch-points with your company by finding the right problem-behavior fit and building trust by solving frequent annoyances, or urgent or costly problems.
Understand the existing situation in order to improve it for your target group.

## The Detailed Structure

1. **Customer Segements** Who is your customer
2. **Problems / Pains + frequency** Focus on Frequent, Costly or Urgent Problem to solve
3. **Triggers to Act** Design Triggers that fit real Life, spark associations, make it familiar
4. **Emotions before & after** Add Emotions for Stronger Message
5. **Available Solutions** How are you going to be different than Competition?
6. **Customer State Limitations** Explore Limitations to Buy/use your product or service
7. **Behavior + its intensity** Tap into, resemble or support existing behavior
8. **Channels of behavior online & offline** Be where your customers are
9. **Root / Cause of every problem** Understand the cause of the Problem
10. **Your Solution** Your Down to earth Solution guess

## The overview of the Structure

- Customer State fit: to make sure you understand your target group, their limitations and their currently available solutions, against which you are going to compete.
- Problem-Behavior fit: to help you filter out the noise and identify the most urgent and frequent problems, understand the real reasons behind them and see which behavior supports it. Is this behavior weak or infrequent â€” is it a problem worth solving?
- Communication-Channel fit: to help you sharpen your communication with strong triggers, emotional messaging and reaching customers via the right channels.
- Solution guess: translate all the validated data you have gathered into a solution that fits the customer state and his/her limitations, solves a real problem and taps into the common behavior of your target group.

### Customer State Fit

1. Customer Segements
2. Customer State Limitations
3. Available Solutions

The goal: to help you understand your target group, their limitations and their available solutions, against which you are going to compete.

Questions to answer:

Who is your customer?
What limits your customer from acting when a problem occurs?
E.g. Spending power, network connection, available devices.
What solutions are available to the customer when he or she is facing the problem?
What has he/she tried in the past?
What are the pros/cons of existing solutions?

### Problem Behavior Fit

2. Problems / Pains + frequency
3. Root / Cause of every problem
4. Behavior + its intensity

The goal: to help you filter out the noise and identify the most urgent and frequent problems, and understand the real reasons behind them and the behavior that supports them, i.e. Is this behavior, weak, infrequent, not intense enough? Is this a problem worth solving?

Questions to answer:

What problem do you solve for your customer?
There could be more than one, explore it.
How often does this problem occur?
What is the cause of every problem on the list?
What does your customer do about the problem currently (around it / directly or indirectly related to it)?
How often does this related behavior happen?

### Communication Channel Fit

3. Triggers to Act
4. Emotions before & after
5. Channels of behavior online & offline

The goal: to help you sharpen your communication with strong triggers, emotional messaging and reaching your customers via the right channels.

Questions to answer:

What triggers customer to act?
Which emotions do people feel before / after this problem is resolved?Use it in your communication strategy.
Where online does this behavior happen?
Extract online and offline channels from the Behavior block.

### Solution Guess / Problem Solution Fit

10. Your Solution

The goal: to match gathered data to the best solution that fits into customer behavior and constraints.

Rules of this block:

If you are trying to find a new solution to an existing problem, fill in this block after youâ€™ve got a better overview of the real situation (complete the other boxes first).
If you are working on an existing solution (exploring growth strategies, problem with activation or solution adoption), then fill this block first, and then see whether your solution is still relevant after all the other blocks are filled in.
Try to spot patterns and repeated keywords (i.e. Searching in Google, collecting on Pinterest) by listing problems and behavior related to it.
For higher chances of solution adoption:

Think of possible solutions that fit the user state limitations, tap into existing behavior, resemble what is already familiar to your target group.
Take the best from alternative solutions â€” simulate natural triggers and tap into existing customer behavior, design a solution that is useful (solves a real problem), understandable (resembles what people already know) and accessible (available via the channels where these people are).
After giving it a first try you will likely realize that you were focusing on a different (less urgent or infrequent) problem, or that the real cause of the situation is worthy of attention. Extract repeated keywords (mediums, devices, situations), frequent behavior and emotions. Thatâ€™s your cheat sheet towards a solution with a higher chance of adoption.

## Working with the canvas.

General approach.

1. State your Vision.
2. Define customer segment.
3. Fit within customer limitations and differentiate / be better than available solutions.
4. Solve a frequent*, urgent or costly problem by analyzing its root/cause, fit into frequent*/natural/familiar behavior which is directly or indirectly related to the underlying problem.
5. Identify triggers that work in real life, and emotions (before/after) to strengthen your communication, so that you can activate your potential customers via online and offline channels, by designing a solution that fits customer limitations, problems and existing behavior.
6. Your solution might become different over time, adjusting to an ever-changing market landscape, but your Vision should stay the same.
