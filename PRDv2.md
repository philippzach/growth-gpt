### 4.2 Core System Components

#### 4.2.1 Enhanced SimplePromptBuilder
```typescript
export class SimplePromptBuilder {
  // Enhanced prompt building with full context
  async buildPrompt(
    taskDefinition: string,
    context: SimplePromptContext, // Contains full previous outputs
    outputFormat: string,
    knowledgeFiles?: string[]
  ): Promise<SimplePrompt>

  // Create enhanced context with workflow awareness
  createEnhancedContext(
    baseContext: SimplePromptContext,
    agentId: string
  ): SimplePromptContext

  // Build structured system prompt
  private buildEnhancedSystemPrompt(
    agentConfig: AgentConfig,
    knowledgeContent?: string
  ): string

  // Build comprehensive instruction prompt
  private buildEnhancedInstructionPrompt(
    taskDefinition: string,
    context: SimplePromptContext,
    outputFormat: string
  ): string
}

export interface SimplePromptContext {
  businessIdea: string;
  userInputs: Record<string, any>;
  previousOutputs: Record<string, string>; // FULL outputs, not summaries
  agentConfig: AgentConfig;
  session: UserSession;
  configLoader?: ConfigLoader;
  workflowPosition?: number; // 1-8
  totalAgents?: number; // 8
}
```

#### 4.2.2 Enhanced ConfigLoader
```typescript
export class ConfigLoader {
  // Load unified agent configuration 
  async loadUnifiedAgentConfig(agentId: string): Promise<UnifiedAgentConfig | null>
  
  // Convert unified to legacy format for compatibility
  convertUnifiedToLegacyConfig(unifiedConfig: UnifiedAgentConfig): AgentConfig
  
  // Load complete agent configuration set
  async loadCompleteAgentConfiguration(agentId: string): Promise<{
    unified: UnifiedAgentConfig | null;
    legacy: AgentConfig | null;
    task: TaskConfig | null;
  }>
  
  // Load knowledge base content
  async loadKnowledgeBase(filePath: string): Promise<string | null>
}
```

#### 4.2.3 Enhanced AgentExecutor with Comprehensive Logging
```typescript
export class AgentExecutor {
  // Execute agent with full logging
  async executeAgent(
    agentId: AgentType,
    generatedPrompt: SimplePrompt,
    context: PromptGenerationContext
  ): Promise<AgentExecutionResult>

  // Comprehensive API request logging
  private logAPIRequest(
    agentId: AgentType,
    apiRequest: Anthropic.MessageCreateParams,
    context: PromptGenerationContext
  ): void

  // Comprehensive API response logging  
  private logAPIResponse(
    agentId: AgentType,
    result: AgentExecutionResult,
    context: PromptGenerationContext
  ): void
}
```

### 4.3 Enhanced Agent Worker Pattern

Each agent worker follows this enhanced pattern:

```typescript
// Load unified configuration
const unifiedConfig = await configLoader.loadUnifiedAgentConfig(AGENT_ID);

// Convert to legacy format for compatibility
const agentConfig = unifiedConfig 
  ? await convertUnifiedToLegacy(unifiedConfig)
  : await configLoader.loadAgentConfig(AGENT_ID);

// Create enhanced context with full previous outputs
const enhancedContext = promptBuilder.createEnhancedContext(
  {
    businessIdea,
    userInputs,
    previousOutputs, // Full previous outputs, not summaries!
    agentConfig,
    session,
    configLoader,
    workflowPosition: 2, // Position in 8-agent workflow
    totalAgents: 8,
  },
  AGENT_ID
);

// Define relevant knowledge files
const knowledgeFiles = [
  'knowledge-base/method/specific-methodology.md',
  'knowledge-base/resources/relevant-framework.md',
];

// Generate dynamic output format from unified config
const outputFormat = unifiedConfig 
  ? generateOutputFormatFromConfig(unifiedConfig.output_specifications)
  : getDefaultOutputFormat();

// Generate enhanced prompt with full context
const prompt = await promptBuilder.buildPrompt(
  unifiedConfig?.task_specification.primary_objective || 'Default task',
  enhancedContext,
  outputFormat,
  knowledgeFiles
);
```

## 11. Development Guidelines

### 11.1 Enhanced Agent Development Pattern

When creating or updating agents, follow this pattern:

1. **Create Unified Configuration** (`agents/{agent-id}-unified.yaml`)
2. **Implement Enhanced Worker** with unified config loading
3. **Add Comprehensive Logging** for debugging and monitoring
4. **Test Full Context Sharing** with previous agents
5. **Validate Prompt Quality** using logging output
6. **Update Workflow Integration** for seamless handoffs

### 11.2 Code Quality Standards

**TypeScript Requirements:**
- Strict type checking enabled
- Complete interface definitions
- Comprehensive error handling
- Full test coverage

**Prompt Engineering Standards:**
- Structured System/Instruction format
- Full context utilization (no summaries)
- Knowledge base integration
- Quality validation and scoring

**Configuration Standards:**
- Unified YAML schema compliance
- Complete agent specifications
