# Problem Solution Fit Canvas

The Problem-Solution Fit canvas is based on the principles of Lean Startup, LUM (Lazy User Model) and User Experience design. It helps entrepreneurs, marketers and corporate innovators identify behavioral patterns and recognize what would work and why.

It helps you to:
Solve complex problems in a way that fits the state of your customers.
Succeed faster and increase your solution adoption by tapping into existing mediums and channels of behavior.
Sharpen your communication and marketing strategy with the right triggers and messaging.
Increase touch-points with your company by finding the right problem-behavior fit and building trust by solving frequent annoyances, or urgent or costly problems.
Understand the existing situation in order to improve it for your target group.

## Working with the canvas.

General approach.

1. State your Vision.
2. Define customer segment.
3. Fit within customer limitations and differentiate / be better than available solutions.
4. Solve a frequent*, urgent or costly problem by analyzing its root/cause, fit into frequent*/natural/familiar behavior which is directly or indirectly related to the underlying problem.
5. Identify triggers that work in real life, and emotions (before/after) to strengthen your communication, so that you can activate your potential customers via online and offline channels, by designing a solution that fits customer limitations, problems and existing behavior.
6. Your solution might become different over time, adjusting to an ever-changing market landscape, but your Vision should stay the same.

## The Detailed Structure

1. **Customer Segements** Who is your customer
2. **Problems / Pains + frequency** Focus on Frequent, Costly or Urgent Problem to solve
3. **Triggers to Act** Design Triggers that fit real Life, spark associations, make it familiar
4. **Emotions before & after** Add Emotions for Stronger Message
5. **Available Solutions** How are you going to be different than Competition?
6. **Customer State Limitations** Explore Limitations to Buy/use your product or service
7. **Behavior + its intensity** Tap into, resemble or support existing behavior
8. **Channels of behavior online & offline** Be where your customers are
9. **Root / Cause of every problem** Understand the cause of the Problem
10. **Your Solution** Your Down to earth Solution guess

### Solution Validation

to make sure you understand your target group, their limitations and their currently available solutions, against which you are going to compete.

1. Customer Segements
2. Customer State Limitations
3. Available Solutions

The goal: to help you understand your target group, their limitations and their available solutions, against which you are going to compete.

Questions to answer:

Who is your customer?
What limits your customer from acting when a problem occurs?
E.g. Spending power, network connection, available devices.
What solutions are available to the customer when he or she is facing the problem?
What has he/she tried in the past?
What are the pros/cons of existing solutions?

### Problem Behavior Fit

to help you filter out the noise and identify the most urgent and frequent problems, understand the real reasons behind them and see which behavior supports it. Is this behavior weak or infrequent — is it a problem worth solving?

2. Problems / Pains + frequency
3. Root / Cause of every problem
4. Behavior + its intensity

The goal: to help you filter out the noise and identify the most urgent and frequent problems, and understand the real reasons behind them and the behavior that supports them, i.e. Is this behavior, weak, infrequent, not intense enough? Is this a problem worth solving?

Questions to answer:

What problem do you solve for your customer?
There could be more than one, explore it.
How often does this problem occur?
What is the cause of every problem on the list?
What does your customer do about the problem currently (around it / directly or indirectly related to it)?
How often does this related behavior happen?

### Communication Hypothesis

to help you sharpen your communication with strong triggers, emotional messaging and reaching customers via the right channels.

3. Triggers to Act
4. Emotions before & after
5. Channels of behavior online & offline

The goal: to help you sharpen your communication with strong triggers, emotional messaging and reaching your customers via the right channels.

Questions to answer:

What triggers customer to act?
Which emotions do people feel before / after this problem is resolved?Use it in your communication strategy.
Where online does this behavior happen?
Extract online and offline channels from the Behavior block.

### Solution Guess / Problem Solution Fit

translate all the validated data you have gathered into a solution that fits the customer state and his/her limitations, solves a real problem and taps into the common behavior of your target group.

10. Your Solution

The goal: to match gathered data to the best solution that fits into customer behavior and constraints.

Rules of this block:

If you are trying to find a new solution to an existing problem, fill in this block after you’ve got a better overview of the real situation (complete the other boxes first).
If you are working on an existing solution (exploring growth strategies, problem with activation or solution adoption), then fill this block first, and then see whether your solution is still relevant after all the other blocks are filled in.
Try to spot patterns and repeated keywords (i.e. Searching in Google, collecting on Pinterest) by listing problems and behavior related to it.
For higher chances of solution adoption:

Think of possible solutions that fit the user state limitations, tap into existing behavior, resemble what is already familiar to your target group.
Take the best from alternative solutions — simulate natural triggers and tap into existing customer behavior, design a solution that is useful (solves a real problem), understandable (resembles what people already know) and accessible (available via the channels where these people are).
After giving it a first try you will likely realize that you were focusing on a different (less urgent or infrequent) problem, or that the real cause of the situation is worthy of attention. Extract repeated keywords (mediums, devices, situations), frequent behavior and emotions. That’s your cheat sheet towards a solution with a higher chance of adoption.
