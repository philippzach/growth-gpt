# Retention

Do people need to use our service daily, weekly or monthly to be considered retained?

## Core Concept

Retention is about creating habitual usage patterns that match your product's natural frequency. It's not about forcing daily usage - it's about aligning your product rhythm with user needs and measuring loyalty accordingly.

## Natural Usage Frequency Patterns

- **Daily**: Communication, productivity, entertainment, news (Slack, Gmail, Instagram)
- **Weekly**: Planning, shopping, learning, fitness tracking (Notion, Amazon, Duolingo)
- **Monthly**: Financial, reporting, subscription management (banking apps, analytics)
- **Event-Driven**: Travel, major purchases, life events (Airbnb, wedding planning)
- **Seasonal**: Tax software, holiday shopping, fitness (January spike)

## Determining Your Retention Cadence

1. **User Need Frequency**: How often does the core problem occur?
2. **Value Delivery Rhythm**: When does your product create new value?
3. **Competitive Benchmarks**: What frequency do similar products achieve?
4. **Business Model Alignment**: Does usage frequency match revenue model?

## Retention Measurement Framework

- **Day 1/7/30 Retention**: % of users who return after signup
- **Cohort Analysis**: Track retention curves over time by user segment
- **Usage Depth**: Not just "did they return" but "how deeply did they engage"
- **Natural Cadence**: Measure against expected frequency, not arbitrary daily goals

## The Retention Hierarchy

1. **Initial Return**: User comes back after first session
2. **Habit Formation**: Regular usage pattern established (21-66 days)
3. **Value Integration**: Product becomes part of user's workflow/life
4. **Advocacy**: User recommends and helps others discover value

## Building Retention Mechanisms

- **Progressive Value**: Each session delivers increasing value
- **Contextual Triggers**: Reminders tied to user context, not spam
- **Social Accountability**: Community, sharing, or collaboration features
- **Personalization**: Product adapts and improves with usage
- **Achievement Systems**: Progress tracking and milestone celebration

## Retention Strategy by Product Type

- **Utility Products**: Focus on workflow integration and efficiency gains
- **Social Products**: Build network effects and FOMO (fear of missing out)
- **Content Products**: Create anticipation and discovery mechanisms
- **Productivity Products**: Demonstrate cumulative progress and ROI
- **Entertainment Products**: Variety, surprise, and emotional engagement

## Key Retention Principles

- **Frequency Follows Function**: Don't force unnatural usage patterns
- **Compound Value**: Each usage should build on previous sessions
- **Friction Reduction**: Remove barriers to returning users
- **Expectation Setting**: Be clear about when/why users should return

## Warning Signs of Poor Retention

- **Declining Engagement**: Sessions getting shorter or less frequent
- **Feature Abandonment**: Users stop using core features
- **Support Ticket Patterns**: Repetitive confusion or frustration
- **Cohort Degradation**: New user cohorts performing worse than old ones

## Retention Optimization Questions

- What would make a user NEED to come back next week/month?
- How can we make the product more valuable with each use?
- What triggers in the user's life/work create natural return moments?
- How do we measure engagement quality, not just frequency?
