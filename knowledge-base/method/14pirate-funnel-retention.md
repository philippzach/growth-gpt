# Retention

Do people need to use our service daily, weekly or monthly to be considered retained?
What would make a user NEED to come back next week/month?
How can we make the product more valuable with each use?
What triggers in the user's life/work create natural return moments?
How do we measure engagement quality, not just frequency?
