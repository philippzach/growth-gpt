# Product Market Fit Canvas

## What is Product-Market Fit?

Product-market fit describes a scenario in which a company’s target customers are buying, using, and telling others about the company’s product in numbers large enough to sustain that product’s growth and profitability.
Product-market fit means finding a good market with a product capable of satisfying that market.

How many companies achieve product market fit?
Many do not. According to CB Insights, 42% of failed startups cited “no market need” as a key reason. Achieving product/market fit is a critical milestone and often a turning point for sustainable growth.

It’s important to note that achieving product/market fit is a significant challenge for many businesses, particularly startups. Many industry experts and venture capitalists, such as Marc Andreessen, consider achieving product/market fit to be one of the most critical milestones for a startup, and one that many fail to reach.

Achieving product/market fit requires a deep understanding of your customers, a product that meets a real need, and the ability to communicate that effectively. It’s a process of iteration and learning, and even successful companies may need to revisit and reassess their product/market fit as they scale and as market conditions change.

## How do you prove product-market fit?

Proving product-market fit involves demonstrating that there’s a significant demand for your product in the market and that your product is meeting the needs of your target audience. Here are some ways you can prove product-market fit:

- Customer Surveys. The Sean Ellis Test is a good starting point. If over 40% of your users say they would be “very disappointed” if they could no longer use your product, it’s a strong indicator of product-market fit. Other survey questions could explore customer satisfaction, net promoter score (NPS), and reasons for using your product.
- Usage and Retention Metrics. High user engagement and retention rates can signal product-market fit. If users are not only trying your product but also using it regularly over time, it’s a sign they find value in it.
- Organic Growth. A strong sign of product-market fit is when new customers are primarily acquired through word-of-mouth or organic channels, suggesting that existing users value the product enough to recommend it to others.
- Willingness to Pay. If customers are willing to pay for your product at a price that is sustainable for your business, this is a strong indication of product-market fit. You can gauge this through customer surveys or by testing different pricing strategies.
- Market Feedback. Positive reviews, social media mentions, and press coverage can all signal that your product is resonating with your target audience.
- Customer Interviews: Conducting in-depth interviews with customers can provide qualitative insights into how well your product is meeting their needs.

Remember that proving product-market fit is not a one-time event but an ongoing process. Market needs and conditions can change, and it’s important to continually check in with your customers and monitor your key metrics to ensure you’re maintaining product-market fit.
