# Unique Selling Proposition

After finishing this you should have a USP (unique value proposition) that differentiates you from your competitors and you can use to market your product to the right audience.

Your unique factor directly relates to the type of clients you will land and who your customers are
What makes you - you
How would you act with no social pressure around you?

## Differentiate Yourself

It’s your job to assist them by making your unique selling proposition obvious, different and memorable enough that they can see exactly what your business has to offer that possible competitors do not.

It does not have to be about the product or service. It can be purely the vision.

## Purpose Driven Entrepreneurs

Who are you helping?

Charities?
Young organizations?
Building schools?
Building communities?
Health associations?
Inspiring the leaders of tomorrow?
Spitual?

## Don’t Spend Your Time Convincing People

You’re not trying to convince people

You’re to live by example

Put this lifestyle into your unique selling proposition

# Golden Cycle Framework

### Overview

**The Golden Circle Framework:** Great leaders and organizations think, act, and communicate differently from everyone else. While most people communicate from the outside in (What → How → Why), inspiring leaders start from the inside out (Why → How → What). Every organization knows what they do, some know how they do it, but very few know why they do it - their purpose, cause, or belief. This "why" isn't about making profit (that's a result), but about the deeper purpose that drives the organization.
**The Power of Starting with Why:** Apple exemplifies this approach. Instead of saying "We make great computers that are beautifully designed" (what/how), they communicate "We believe in challenging the status quo and thinking differently. We happen to make great computers." This explains why people buy diverse Apple products - they're not buying the product, they're buying the belief. The concept is rooted in biology: our limbic brain controls decision-making and emotions but has no capacity for language, while our neocortex processes rational information. When we communicate from the inside out, we speak directly to the decision-making part of the brain.
**Real-World Applications:** The Wright Brothers succeeded over the well-funded Samuel Langley because they were driven by a belief that powered flight would change the world, while Langley pursued fame and fortune. Similarly, Martin Luther King didn't have a plan - he had a dream and belief that inspired 250,000 people to show up in Washington. According to the law of diffusion of innovation, you need to reach the innovators and early adopters (who make gut decisions based on beliefs) before achieving mass market success.
**The Key Insight:** People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. The goal isn't to do business with everyone who needs what you have, but with people who believe what you believe. This creates loyalty, inspiration, and sustainable success because you're attracting those who share your values and vision.
