# Growth Hacking Dictionary

## A

### A/B Testing

A marketing experiment where two variations of a landing page, ad, email or other piece of online content are pitted against each other to determine which produces the highest conversion rate. A/B testing is the key to optimizing your marketing campaign.

### Above the Fold

The top portion of a web page that's visible without scrolling. Whatever content is above the fold is what your prospects will see when they arrive on your landing page. If it's not relevant, they might bounce.

### Acquisition

(Often) The second step of the Pirate Funnel. Getting customers to register/sign up, or have them take that first meaningful action that you want them to take after they land on your website (or in your store!). Acquisition is what conversion marketing is ultimately about.

### Active User

What an Active User is for you depends on your product or service.
Think about what goals your users are achieving with your product/service and what steps they take to achieve those goals. This is tightly connected to your WOW-moment. Example: A music service may consider a user as an Active User when they stream a song on a particular day. Depending on the product/service you want to look at Daily Active Users (DAU), Weekly Active Users (WAU), Monthly Active Users (MAU) etc.

### Ad Copy

The part of your ad whose job is to persuade people to click. Great ad copy starts the conversation that you'll continue on your landing page.

### Ad Rank

An invisible value that determines the position of your PPC ad on the search results page, including whether or not it's displayed at all. Ad Rank is primarily determined by your bid amount and the Quality Score.

### Advocate

Someone who refers your product to a friend or colleague

### Agreeableness

Higher: Value getting along with others. They have a more optimistic view of human nature.
Lower: Value self interests over others. They are more skeptical of others' motives.

### Analytics

The discipline of discovering relevant patterns and actionable insights in data. Analytics allow you to determine whether your marketing is actually working.

### Anxiety

What your potential customer feels when confronted with friction on your landing page or website. Anxiety occurs when your page poorly communicates your value proposition or creates doubt in the user's mind.

### Artificial Virality

When your product does not have this inherent component of virality to it. You will have to come up with ways to incentivize people to share your product. A systematic way that your company encourages people to tell others about your product or service. Think about the 5 building blocks of a referral program: Advocate, Advocate Reward, Friend, Friend Reward, Conditions.

### Attention

What you need to earn from your prospects before you attempt to convert them. Every page element should capture and hold your prospect's attention and direct them toward your conversion goal.

### Attention Ratio

The ratio of links on a landing page to the number of campaign conversion goals. In an optimized campaign, your attention ratio should be 11. Because every campaign has one goal, every corresponding landing page should have only one call to action - one place to click.

### Attention Driven Design

A framework for using visual design to draw attention to the most important elements of your page in order to drive conversions.
Attention-driven design techniques include contrast, emphasis and encapsulation.

### Awareness

The first step in the Pirate Funnel. Getting people to visit your website or store.

## B

### Behavioral Cohor

A set of users with shared behaviors and properties, e.g. users who have made at least five purchases within the last 30 days.

### Benefits

The value people get from your product or service. Not to be mistaken with features, which just describe your offer. A good value proposition should focus on benefits, not features, and answer the question,
"What's in it for me?"

### Bounce Rate

The percentage of people who arrive on your website or landing page and leave without viewing any additional pages.

### BRASS

The Growth Tribe framework for ranking Awareness/Top of the funnel experiments in a fair way. BRASS is an acronym for Blink, Relevance, Availability, Scalability, Score. With Awareness ideas it's important that they are scalable, that's the biggest difference between PIES and BRASS. We use the PIES framework for experiments beyond Awareness.

### Broad Match

The default method of keyword-matching in PPC campaigns, broad match displays your ad with relevant keywords, even if they aren't exactly the keywords you targeted. So if your ad targets "kids' bicycles," it may also be presented with results for "children's bicycles."

## C

### Call to Action

The one thing you want people to click on your page. Your call to action is the big shiny button you're trying to steer attention toward, the "ask" every campaign is built around.

### Campaign

A series of marketing activities designed to achieve clearly defined goals within a specified time frame. Whether the ultimate goal is to acquire new customers, launch a new product, promote brand awareness or generate leads, smart conversion marketers think in terms of campaigns.

### Campaign Momentum

Maintaining the message of your campaign from ad to post-conversion and everything in between. Campaign momentum is about removing the break in communication that can occur after the first click. Your copy, tone, offer and design should be consistent throughout each campaign.

### Campaign Objective

The ultimate goal of your marketing campaign. For example, "get more leads" or "sell more widgets." Campaign objectives should be SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timely.

### Clarity

A conversion-centered design principle defined by how easy it is to understand the offer on your website or landing page. Clarity almost always converts better than cleverness - but you should test that.

### Click-Through Page

A landing page without a form. A click-through page is often used as the middleman between your ad and ecommerce shopping cart. Its purpose is to warm up visitors to your unique value proposition before sending them deeper into the marketing funnel.

### Click-Through Rate (CTR)

The ratio of how many people see your ad or email to how many people click on it. You want your click-through rate to be high but optimizing your CTR is only a means to achieving your campaign goal.

### Click-to-Call Button

A button on your mobile landing page or website that allows people to immediately call you. Click-to-call buttons are useful on pages that feature complex products or services and make it easy for people to get their questions answered.

### CLTV

Customer Lifetime Value. Basically how much money you're expecting to make per customer for the duration that they are a customer with your product/service.

### Confidence Level

The probability that the winning variation of your A/B test had more conversions for reasons other than chance. Before declaring a winner, you want a confidence level of 959 or more, as well as a sufficient number of conversions. A lot of A/B-testing tools calculate this for you.

### Confirmation Email

An automated email sent to a lead after they subscribe to your list. Also known as a "double opt-in," this may reduce your list size but it will improve its quality, which will likely increase your open and click-through rates. A confirmation email is a great opportunity to drive the subscriber further down the marketing funnel by sharing additional content or offers.

### Confirmation Page

The first page visitors see after converting. Since trust has just been established, confirmation pages present a good opportunity to ask for something else. For instance, a social share, blog subscription or repeat purchase.

### Congruence

The alignment of every landing page element with your single campaign goal. Congruence is a high-level conversion-centered design principle. If a piece of copy or image on your page isn't aligned with your campaign, it's going to cause friction and hurt your conversion rate.

### Conscientiousness

Higher: More self-disciplined, dutiful, or aiming for achievement against measures or outside expectations.
Lower: More likely to prefer the spontaneous over the planned.

### Content Marketing

The discipline of creating editorial content that serves a business objective, such as attracting prospects, establishing credibility or converting customers. Content marketing is about building a long-term relationship with your audience while delivering as much value and delight as possible.

### Context

A conversion-centered design principle that involves understanding the needs and motivations of your target audience and designing every piece of your campaign with them in mind. The more you understand the context of where your user is coming from and what they're looking for, the higher conversion rate you'll get on your landing page.

### Context of Use

Clearly demonstrating how your product will be used by real people in real life. Classic infomercials like the ShamWow or the Magic Bullet were so effective because they demonstrated context of use, showcasing the products in action.

### Continuance

A conversion centered design technique that uses the momentum of one conversion to drive a secondary conversion request, like a social share or a newsletter signup. Confirmation pages and thank you emails are prime channels for continuance. Ties in with the Commitment/Consistency principle of Cialdini.

### Contrast

Using color to draw attention to an element on your page. A quick rule of thumb is to look for the dominant hue of your page and pick its contrasting color for your call to action. A trick you can use is downloading the Chrome add-on 'Grayscale' to make your page black and grey to quickly see issues with contrast.

### Control Page

The A in A/B testing. The control page is the existing landing page whose conversion rate you're trying to beat. The B in the test is the
'experimental' condition.

### Conversation Momentum

Maintaining the same conversational style and tone across all campaign channels. If your ad copy is super casual, why get serious on your landing page? That's just confusing.

### Conversion

The ultimate goal of your campaign. A conversion is whatever you decide it is - submitting a form, downloading a piece of content, signing up for a free trial, making a purchase. Every aspect of your marketing campaign should be nudging people toward conversion.

### Conversion Centered Design

Conversion-Centered Design is a 7-part framework for creating high-converting marketing campaigns using landing pages — leveraging principles of persuasive design, psychology, and communication.

### Conversion Coupling

The bond that exists between the pre-click experience and the corresponding post-click landing experience. Conversion coupling means maintaining consistent messaging throughout your campaign.

### Conversion Marketing

The discipline of creating successful online marketing experiences for both businesses and customers- and constantly improving them through testing.

### Conversion Rate

The percentage of people who complete your campaign goal. If your conversion rate is low, it's time to optimize your landing page or website. That's where A/B testing comes in.

### Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

The practice of continually improving your website or landing pages capacity to convert visitors into leads or customers. Conversion rate optimization is all about making your marketing more successful.

### Copywriting

The art and science of crafting psychologically persuasive ads, landing pages and other content that inspires action. Copywriting is writing for conversion.

### Cost per Acquisition (CPA)

The total cost of converting someone. Cost Per Acquisition is often one of the ultimate metrics for any marketing department because you don't want to spend more money to convert a customer than they're worth.

### Cost per Click (CPC)

The amount you'll pay when a user clicks on your PPC ad. An ad's actual CPC will fluctuate depending on its Quality Score and the maximum bid made by both yourself and other advertisers competing for the same keywords.

### Credibility

A measure of how believable and trustworthy your marketing is perceived to be. You can communicate credibility by including security badges, ratings, reviews and testimonials on your website or landing page. (Social Proof, Authority)

## D

### Decision Fatigue

A negative psychological reaction to having too much choice. The more options your prospect is faced with, the more anxiety they feel, the more likely they are to bounce. Keep it simple. One campaign goal, one call to action.

### Descriptive analytics

Inspecting and exploring the information. Basically just looking around the data.

### Design Match

A measure of how closely the visual design elements of a landing page match the ad, email or website that brought you there. The more familiar the branding and imagery is on your page, the more confident your prospect will be that they're on the right path.

### Directional Cues

Visual elements that guide visitors toward strategic areas of your landing page, particularly your call to action. There are two types of directional cues: explicit and suggestive. Explicit cues take the form of arrows or lines while suggestive cues use imagery to subtly direct your prospect's gaze.

## E

### Email Marketing

A permission-based marketing channel that can help nurture large numbers of leads into customers over time. Email marketing is one of the most personal and powerful campaign tactics so it must be handled with care.

### Empathy

The capacity to share and recognize the emotions felt by another being. In the context of conversion marketing, empathy allows you to understand your target audience, create relevant offers and engage with them in an authentic way.

### Emphasis

Visually indicating the importance of a word or element on your page using bolding, contrast, encapsulation or other conversion centered design techniques. Emphasis on conversion.

### Encapsulation

An attention-driven design technique that uses boxes, colors or shading to encase a form or other landing page element with the goal of making it stand out.

### Event

An event is an action a user takes in your app or SaaS product. This could be anything from pushing a button, completing a level, or making a payment. Depending on your type of app you should aim to track between 15 and 200 events to get a full understanding of how users are engaging with your app.

### Event Property

Reflects more detailed information about an event at the time it was tracked. These properties highly depend on the type of app you have and the specific information you think is necessary for understanding a particular event. General keys we have seen are cause, description, category, type, duration, level, % completed, name, count, source, status, from, number, lives, authenticated, error, rank, action, and mode.

### Exact Match

A setting within Google AdWords that ensures your ad is only displayed when the user's query exactly matches your keyword, or is a close variation (like a plural form or misspelling).

For example, if your keyword is "shoe polish," even a user searching for
"black shoe polish" won't see it.

### Extroversion/Introversion

Higher (Extroversion): More energetic and pronounced engagement with the external world. Likes high group visibility, talking, and asserting themselves.
Lower (Introversion): Needs less stimulation and are more independent of their social world. It does not mean they are shy, unfriendly, or antisocial.

## F

### Failed Test

An A/B testing or multivariate testing outcome where the variants were unable to produce a conversion lift over the control page. A failed test is a misnomer since a negative outcome can still produce valuable insights.

### Features

A factual statement about a product or service, but not what most people care about. Instead, focus on the benefits of your offer and how it will improve your prospect's life.

### Form Love

An almost impossible state of mind whereby a visitor actually enjoys filling out a form. Form love can be achieved by designing your form as a standalone unit and ensuring it tells the complete story around your offering.

### Framing

A psychological technique whereby information is presented in a way that "frames" it in a positive or negative light. Framing can be an effective technique for presenting pricing or testimonials; for example, $1/day for software sounds more feasible than $30/month.

### Friction

The psychological resistance that your visitors experience when trying to complete an action. Friction is a conversion killer usually caused by unclear messaging, lack of information or poor layout.

### Funnel

A customized series of events that a user goes through to successfully do something in your app, such as successful onboarding.

## G

### Geo Targeting

A method of ad targeting that allows you to specify the geographical regions in which your ads will be shown. Targeting your ads based on location and language can increase conversions, particularly in the case of brick-and-mortar businesses.

### Geo Fencing

Using technology that allows marketers to create a virtual radius around a real world area and then send messages to people's mobile devices when they enter it. So long as you have permission, geo-fencing is an effective way to market to people who are in the right context to convert.

### GROWS

The Growth Consultant process for data driven full funnel marketing based on rapid experimentation. It's an acronym for Generate ideas, Rank ideas, Outline experiments, Work, Study the data.

### Growth Hacking

Coined by Sean Ellis, who defines growth hackers as people whose
"true north is growth." We have a video on What is Growth Hacking in which we explain that Growth Hacking or Growth Marketing is data driven full funnel marketing based on rapid experimentation. The line between Marketing and Product is dissolving.

## H

### Hero Shot

A visual representation of your offer that demonstrates how your product or service actually works so your prospects can picture themselves using it. The hero shot is generally a photo or a video and should clearly show benefits and context of use.

## I

### Inbound Marketing

A permission-based marketing approach that focuses on attracting leads through useful content, engagement and optimization. Coined by HubSpot CEO Brian Halligan, inbound marketing is all about developing awesome content to attract and convert qualified leads.

### Inherent Virality

When a product or service has an inherent component to it that makes the users want to invite others to get the value. For example:
Social Media

### Interruption

An attention-driven design technique that purposely breaks the flow of the user experience to capture their attention - for example, a hard visual design break or the use of a pop-up when leaving a page.
Interruption can be powerful but should be used sparingly to avoid pissing people off.

## K

### Keyword Research

The process of discovering which keywords you should be targeting in your PPC campaigns.
Optimal keywords are relevant to your offering and are actively being searched for.

## L

### Landing Page

A campaign-specific page distinct from your main website that has one goal and one call to action. A landing page could be a lead generation page or a click-through page for ecommerce. You should always send campaign traffic to a dedicated landing page.

### Landing Page Design

The visual, architectural and experiential aspects of your landing page.
A beautiful landing page design doesn't just look good, it's optimized for conversion. Every design element on your page should nudge visitors toward your call to action.

### Landing Page Element

A discrete unit on your landing page. Every landing page should have five key elements: a unique selling proposition, hero shot, clear benefits, social proof and a single call to action. Combined, these elements are a no-fail recipe for a high-converting landing page.

### Landing Page Headline

The first element people see on your landing page. A landing page headline should clearly convey your unique value proposition while matching the copy in the ad that was clicked and in your call to action button.

### Landing Page Optimization

The process of continuously improving the conversion rate of a landing page through A/B testing. To be successful at landing page optimization, you've got to balance customer feedback, intuition, best practices, rigorous research. Test everything and you'll learn what works for your business.

### Lead Generation

Often abbreviated as "lead gen," lead generation is the process of attracting and converting qualified prospects to fill your sales funnel.

There are many types of lead generation campaigns, but the goal is usually the same: collect a user's email address and follow up with lead nurturing.

The most effective way to optimize your marketing campaigns for more leads is to use landing pages, forms, strong offers and clear calls to action.

### Lead Nurturing

The act of educating a lead and moving them through the stages of your company's customer lifecycle, improving the quality of that lead over time. Lead nurturing is about building trust and reciprocal relationships with your prospects.

### Leads

A lead is someone who has shown interest in your business by providing their email or other contact information. Lead generation is only worth your time if you have a game plan to nurture leads toward conversion.

### Leak

Any link on your page that takes someone away from your conversion goal. Avoid leaks by sending campaign traffic to a dedicated landing page with only one call to action.

### Long Tail Keywords

Keywords targeted at highly-specific search queries containing three or more words. "Leather jacket" is a popular keyword, whereas "men's leather jacket size small" is a long tail keyword.
While long tail keywords are less popular individually, they cumulatively form the majority of search queries.

## M

### Marketing Funnel

A model describing the various stages of a prospect's journey from the first interaction with your brand to the ultimate goal: conversion.
Conversion rate optimization is about moving people through your marketing funnel, turning them from prospects into raving, repeat customers.

### Message Match

A measure of how well your landing page copy matches the phrasing of the ad or link that brought the visitor there. For PPC marketers, this means matching your ad copy to your landing page headline. Strong message match increases conversions because it reassures people they've come to the right place.

### Mobile First

The technique of designing your campaign, landing page or website for mobile first, then desktop. If you work within the constraints of mobile first, you'll be forced to cut out irrelevant elements that distract from your conversion goal.

### Mobile Optimization

Ensuring that your visitor's experience is calibrated to whichever device they're using. Mobile optimization is all about optimizing for intent; your website and landing pages should allow your visitors to accomplish what they want to do on any device.

### Mobile-Friendly Form

An easy-to-complete lead generation form that allows users to input data while on the go. Mobile-friendly forms are often automated to validate information immediately so prospects don't have to resubmit the form several times. Typeform is a great tool to make Any-Device-Friendly Forms

### Mobile Optimized Copy

Copy that considers a mobile user's context and intent to maximize the chance of conversion. Mobile-optimized copy should be concise to account for smaller screens and shorter attention spans.

### Motion

An attention-driven design technique that uses moving elements to draw attention to a page element. For example, parallax scrolling pages frequently leverage motion effects to draw attention to a call to action.

### Mulivariate Testing

The discipline of testing multiple combinations of page elements simultaneously to identify which combination yields the highest conversion rate. Because it compares a greater number of variables than A/B testing, multivariate testing can only lead to statistically significant results when you are already driving a lot of traffic.

## N

### Natural Virality

When your product or service is so awesome or hyped that people will talk about it naturally and invite others. Example: Pokémon Go went viral. Ice Bucket Challenge went viral, etc.

### Negative Keyword

Keywords that you don't want your ads to be displayed alongside of.
Use them to ensure your ad isn't placed with irrelevant searches. This keeps you from paying for clicks that won't give you any value.

### Neuroticism

Higher: More likely to have negative emotions or get upset. It could mean they are going through a tough time.
Lower: More calm and less likely to get upset. It does not mean they are positive, or happy people.

### New User

A new user is a user who has logged an event for the first time (this includes inactive events). The time of when the user is new is the time of when they logged their earliest event

## O

### Open Rate

The percentage of people who open your marketing email. Open rate is calculated by dividing the number of emails opened by the total number of emails sent, excluding bounced messages. Many email service providers let you A/B test variables such as subject line and delivery time to help improve your open rate.

### Openness (to experience)

Higher: Intellectually curious, emotionally aware, sensitive to beauty and willing to try new things.
Lower: Preferring the plain, straightforward, and obvious over the complex, ambiguous, and subtle.

### Optimization

The process of making something as effective and cost-efficient as possible. In conversion marketing, optimization is all about using A/B testing to achieve the highest possible return on your marketing activities with the least amount of money.

## P

### Permission Marketing

The privilege of delivering relevant marketing messages to people who actually want to receive them. Coined by Seth Godin, permission marketing is based on the premise that treating prospects with respect is the best way to get their attention.

### Phrase Match

A setting that ensures your ad is only displayed when the user's search query contains an exact keyword phrase or an extremely close variation, like a misspelling

For example, if your keyword phrase is "organic coffee," a search for
"cheap organic coffee" will display your ad; a search for "free-trade coffee" will not.

### PIES

The Growth Tribe framework for ranking experiments beyond Top of the Funnel (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral and Revenue).
PIES is an acronym for Probability, Impact, Ease, Score. We use BRASS for Awareness experiments.

### Post Conversion

Using the momentum of one conversion to drive a secondary conversion request, usually on the confirmation landing page. Because your customer has already invested time, trust (and perhaps even money) with you, they're more likely to respond positively to a second request.

### Pay per Click (PPC)

A method of digital advertising whereby advertisements are displayed prominently alongside search results. As the name implies, you pay each time one of your ads is clicked.

### Predictive analytics

Predicting the future of your metrics (by Supervised Machine
Learning)

### Predictive modeling

Predicting the future. Supervised machine learning method used to predict values or to which classes new data points belong to.

### Proximity

The distance between the various elements on your landing page.
Even if all the right elements are present, you should test their proximity to one another; for example, test bringing elements of social proof closer to your CTA to reduce prospect anxiety and increase conversions.

## Q

### Quality Score

A component of Google AdWords shrouded in mystery. A high Quality Score means that your ads, keywords and landing pages appear relevant to one another, to what a customer is searching for and, most importantly, to Google.

## R

### Referral

The part in the Pirate Funnel about having your users refer others to use your product or service as well. Is there natural virality in your product? Inherent virality, or artificial virality

### Relevance

A measure of how relevant your offer, product or service is to the wants and needs of a visitor. Remember that your visitors' attention spans are lower than ever; an offer has to communicate relevance immediately.

### Remarketing

Tactics used by marketers to follow up with leads that expressed interest but haven't converted, usually through automated or triggered emails. Remarketing to prospects who have self-identified as being interested in what you have to offer can help increase conversions.

### Responsive Design

A design approach geared toward tailoring a web page for mobile users. A responsive landing page should automatically detect your prospect's screen size and adjust the layout and content accordingly.
This means you don't have to build multiple versions of the same page, enhances the user's experience and increases their likelihood of converting.

### Retargeting

Sending targeted messages or ads to prospects who have indicated interest in your offer but haven't yet converted. Retargeting is effective because it focuses on people who are familiar with your brand and have recently demonstrated interest.

### Retention

The part of the Pirate Funnel where you measure how often your users are returning to your app over some time frame. What are you doing to make sure people keep coming back to your product?

### Return on Investment

A measure of campaign performance, calculated by comparing what you've put in versus what you're getting back. Keeping tabs on the ROl of your campaigns helps you make smarter decisions about how you should be allocating resources.

### Revenue

The part of the Pirate Funnel about making money. What are you doing to sell, cross-sell, upsell? What's your business model?

## S

### Scarcity

A psychological tactic that taps into people's fear of missing out to drive action. One of Robert Cialdini's Six Principles of Persuasion, scarcity could entail adding copy such as "Limited time offer!" or "Only 6 seats left!" to your landing pages.

### Segmentation

The act of dividing a broad target market into smaller subsets based on demographics or behavior. Segmenting your campaign allows you to send each group to their own dedicated landing page so that you can target your offer, determine which segments are performing best and optimize accordingly.

### Session

A session is a period of time that a user has your app in the foreground.
Often it's the case that on web, events within 30 minutes of each other are combined into a single session. On mobile they often use 5 minutes instead of 30 minutes.

### SMS Marketing

A controversial mobile marketing technique that involves sending promotional offers to people's smartphones via text message. So long as prospects opt in, SMS marketing can be an effective way to drive conversions since you're targeting people who actually want to receive your offers.

### Social Media Marketing

The continuous process of posting targeted, useful content via social media platforms with the goal of driving qualified traffic to a blog post, website or landing page. For the greatest reach and effect, smart social media marketers create content that is representative of their brand and helpful to their community members.

### Social Proof

The positive influence that's generated when people find out that
"everybody's doing it." Building social proof into your offer in the form of testimonials, reviews or trust seals is a great way to generate interest, increase credibility and drive more conversions. This is also one of Cialdini's principles.

### Stickiness

Measures the number of different days/weeks a user performs an event in each week/month interval.

### Stop Words

Words that trigger a negative psychological reaction, hindering conversion. Writing "no gimmicks" or "we'll never spam you" near your CTA is usually meant to reassure people, but can backfire by planting seeds of doubt in your prospect's mind.

### Subjectivity

Everyone experiences things differently. For example, it's hard to predict how a landing page testimonial will be perceived by your visitors. The only way to find out is to test.

### Suprise

An attention-driven design technique that uses interruption and wonderment to create delight and drive action. Surprise on a landing page might come in the form of uncommon language or unique design elements.

### Test Hypothesis

A tentative assumption made in order to draw out and test its consequences. An A/B test hypothesis often takes the form of, "I think that changing this into that will have a positive impact on conversions."

### Testimonials

Written, verbal or video quotes from a customer talking about their experiences with your brand. Testimonials bring powerful social proof, but you still need to test; even testimonials from real customers can appear fake to visitors. It's always good to use external platforms and see if you can embed them. This is harder to fake and your customers will have less doubt about the genuity.

### Trust

What every marketer needs to earn from prospects before trying to convert them. You can establish trust with your audience by being transparent, consistent and by refraining from using gimmicky sales tactics.

## U

### Unique Campaign Proposition

A statement that describes the benefits of an offer made in the context of a marketing campaign. The unique campaign proposition needs to be clearly articulated in every element of your campaign, from emails to ads to landing pages.

### Unique User

A unique user is a distinct individual to whom events are attributed.
This is a term that tracking tools such as Amplitude or Mixpanel use for distinct individuals who get their own Unique User ID.

### Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

Also known as a unique selling proposition (USP), your UVP is a clear statement that describes the benefit of your offer, how you solve your customer's needs and what distinguishes you from the competition.
Your unique value proposition should appear prominently on your landing page and in every marketing campaign.

### Urgency

The use of trigger words or scarcity tactics to increase your prospects' sense of having to act immediately. Urgency can be achieved by using phrases such as "act now" or by alluding to a limit in time or supply.

### User Intent

What your prospect's intentions are and how likely they are to convert.
User intent can be gleaned from what they were searching for in the first place. Are they just researching or are they comparing prices?
Understanding user intent allows you to deliver the right offer to the right prospects at the right time.

### User Property

Reflects traits about the individual person using your app. Examples of custom user properties are age, gender, email, locale, referral source, plan type, number of photos uploaded, number of units of in-game currency, and current level in a game. The most important thing to remember is that these user properties reflect the state of the user and apply across all their events.

### User Testing

The practice of putting a computer in front of someone and learning about their behaviour by watching what they do. User testing aims to understand how people interact with your landing page and what they did before they arrived.

## V

### Visualization

All types of charts and dashboards. Stuff that allows data to be understandable rapidly by humans.

## W

### Welcome Email

An automated email message thanking a new subscriber. Since your new lead is still warm, a welcome email is a great time to ask for another conversion, like a social follow.

### Whitespace

A conversion-centered design technique that uses areas of blank space to emphasize a landing page element of your choice.
Whitespace allows you to direct attention to your call to action by giving your prospect's eye only one thing to focus on.
