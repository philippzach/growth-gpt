# The Hierarchy of Engagement

## The big questioin

How do you maximizer your chances of building and enduring $1M+ company?

At the core, it comes down to understanding how to maximize engagement.

## The Framework

- Level 1: Growing engaged users, Focus on growing users completing the core action
- Level 2: Retaining users, Product should get better the more it's used. Users have more to lose by leaving the product.
- Level 3: Self-perpetuating, As users engage, they create virtuous loops in the product

### Growing Engaged Users

What matters is not growth of users. It's **growth of users completing the core action**

The core action is the action that forms the foundation of your product.

for example:
Facebook -> Friending
Pinterest -> Pinning
Snapchat -> Snapping
YouTube -> Subscribing

Most often, the core action is the action most correlated with retention.

    Facebook -> Realized if they fot a user to connect to 7 freinds in ten days, they'd be retained for life.
    Pinterest -> If someone pinned something, we could almost guarantee they'd come back next week.

But it's not the only action your users do.

Otger features support the core action (ladder of engagement), but **ultimate goal is getting people to perform the core action**

    Facebook -> Photos and status updates create reasons to maintain friend graph.
    Youtube -> No point subscribing if no uploaded videos or ability to view

Growind users without growing users completing the core action is the empty calories of growth. **It feels good, but it's not good for you**

Make sure you are focused on **the right core action**

Ask youself: What features would we build if we optimized for people completing the action? Is that the right roadmap?
And then: Will the core action scale to enough users?

#### Fogg Behavior Model

This diagram illustrates the Fogg Behavior Model (FBM), developed by Dr. BJ Fogg at Stanford University. The model explains when and why behaviors occur through a simple equation: Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Trigger.
The graph shows the relationship between motivation (vertical axis) and ability (horizontal axis), with a curved line dividing two regions:
Above the curve (red zone) - "TRIGGER SUCCEEDS": When people have sufficient motivation and ability, a trigger will successfully prompt the desired behavior to occur.
Below the curve (gray zone) - "TRIGGER FAILS": When either motivation or ability (or both) are too low, triggers will fail to produce the target behavior.
The key insight is that these three elements must converge at the same moment for a behavior to happen. The curve represents the threshold where the combination of motivation and ability is just enough for a trigger to be effective.
This model is widely used in behavior design, product development, and habit formation because it shows that you can't rely on motivation alone - you also need to make behaviors easy to do (high ability) and provide appropriate triggers at the right time. It's particularly valuable for understanding why people don't follow through on intended behaviors and how to design more effective interventions.

### Retaining Users

After having engaged users now the question is how to get those users to stick?

How do you build your product to retain users?

Create **accruing benefits and mounting losses** as a user engages.

**Accruing Benefits:**
As a consumer adds data to the product, either explicitly or implicitly, the company uses this data to improve the experience for the users.
"The more I use the product, the better it gets."

**Mounting Losses:**
The longer you stay with the product, the more it becomes a product you depend on, part of your identity, or a place where you've accrued value of some sort.
""The more I use the product, the more I would have to lose if I left the product."

Examples:

Evernote - Core action is creating a note - The more notes you add to evernote the more value you get and the harder it is to leave. - the core action creates accruing benefits and mounting loss.
Pinterest - the more you pin, the more you have to lose- your bookmarks, expression and extension of your identity (mounting loss) - Initially, used following to create acfruing benefits, but later built features that converted core action into accruing benefits e.g. "Picked for you" feature: the more you pin the more personalized your home feed gets

### Self Perpetuating - Growth Loop

Okay, so we now have a growing base of engaged users, and a sticky product.
Now the question is whether your existing users create **virtuous loops** in the product as they engage with it.

**Virtuous loops** are the flywheels that convert your users engagement into fuel to power your company forward.

The strongest virtuous loop is a **network effect**.

1. More users pin
2. Richer interest graph
3. Better discovery experience

Other examples:

Growth 1. Users discovers pin 2. Sends pin to friend 3. Acquires user

Re-engagement 1. User repins 2. Notifies existing user 3. Re-engages user
Growth efforts bossted dormant users in search in order to re-engage them with the repin notification.

Virtuous loops are really hard to create - most products don't have them (though many try) like - Tinder:

    1. Match with someone
    2. Sucessful date
    not 3. More engaged user

Tinder has some virtuous loos. like a match sends a notification to a user which re-engages them. But the most important one - a successful date, is an off-ramp, not an engagement accelerator.

Virtuous Loops propel a company forward. Look for opportunities and maximize them.

## The Most Important Thing to Measure

We talked about 3 things but over time, investors want to see:

1. Growing Engaged Users -> Growth, New users continuing to be engaged
2. Retaining Users -> Retention
3. Virtuous Loops -> Organic growth and retention

### The Ultimate Metric: Cohort performance

The clearest way to understand a companys engagement is to look at cohorts.

    - Number of weekly completing the core action
    - Percentage of weekly active users completing the core action

Cohorts show:

- Growth -> Size of each Cohort
- Engagement -> Ratio of users performing the core action
- Retention -> Cohort performance over time

There are different ways to visualize cohorst (Line graphs, Charts, Triangle Heat Maps)
