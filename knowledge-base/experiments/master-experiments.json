The cool thing about this ad type is that you only pay when a viewer watches at least 30 seconds of your video (or the full duration of the video if it's shorter than 30 seconds) or interacts with your  video, whichever comes first.\n- Non-skippable ads - users don't have an option to skip the ad, but you pay for all impressions it gets.\nTo capture even more real estate with your ads, you can reach users at an earlier step - when they're searching for a video.

Only after your target audience has been seeing your ads for a couple of days/weeks, start your outreach campaign\nWhy does it work? Mere exposure effect - people prefer things they're familiar with.

A company hiring in a given department is a sign it's in a good position to invest more in this area of its business. This creates an outreach opportunity for products from that field (job descriptions offer extra insights on the specifics).\nNew hires. After a person switches jobs, they're likely to introduce new products into their new company - either adopting new ones or replacing existing ones because of personal preference (especially if they're in leadership roles).\nTech changes. Dropping a product from a company's stack opens up the opportunity for a\nreplacement. There's a chance they weren't satisfied with their previous solution and are willing to try another one. Adopting a new piece of software is a signal that a company may need a complimentary one. Based on your technographic research of your customers, find out what other software your product is most often used together with.\nProduct launches. Launching a new product means that a company is looking to grow its market share in that area. If your product can facilitate that, there's a chance they'll need it. Researching other products. Premium plan of G2 (starts at about $10k/year) lets you see which companies visited either your product listing, competitors' listings, or a given product category page.\nLeading tools providing intent data are predictleads.com and bombora.com\nI also wrote a whole article on the topic of intent data a while back: https://www.getscrapbook.com/blog/buyer-intent- data",

    "description": "A 'success milestone' is any form of positive interaction between your business and your users. We've talked earlier about the example of a CRM user closing a deal, but milestones come in all shapes and sizes: from someone using your accounting platform to successfully create and submit a tax return, through to a user selling one of their products thanks to your eCommerce software. \n\nBy tracking these milestones, you can engage with your users when they're most grateful to your brand, and help reinforce a positive relationship. You prove that you care about the success of individual users, and you take the time to recognise their success (and if you're not sure what constitutes a success milestone, simply ask your users!).",

    "description": "It's a universal truth that people love free stuff. When you have particularly evangelical fans and especially dedicated users, it makes sense to reward their hard work, and reinforce their helpful behaviour. To do that., it's as simple as sending them something free, personal and awesome.\n\nI've been on the receiving end of a handful of free gifts, and they never cease to make me feel recognised and grateful. You can experiment with:\n\nBranded postcards with space for a handwritten note\nVinyl stickers to decorate laptops/folders/guitars/anything\nT-shirts\nSpecially branded beers",

    "description": "Your first ~100 customers are hugely important. They provide the first tentative signs that your product has decent market fit, and their early involvement helps refine the future direction of the business. With that importance in mind, it's a great idea to personally reach out to your first users, and get to know them a little bit better.\n\nThis can be as simple as setting up a quick call, or exchanging a few personal emails. Talking about their needs, progress with the product and general thoughts around your business and service can be hugely beneficial, both to the growth of your company and the happiness of your users:\n\nLearn more about the needs of your users, and shape the future development of your product.\nRefine and improve your buyer personas.\nCreate a personal dynamic between your business and your users.",

Even with a perfect resolution to their problem, you can still go a step further to delight your customer, by following up every customer interaction you have.\n\nA simple email or in-app message is enough; and by checking-in on your customers, and seeing if their problems are still resolved, you can work wonders for the business-user dynamic.",

    "description": "In any growing business, problems happen. Servers go down, payments get taken early, and new features go live with bugs and glitches. To help your customers weather the storm of these problems, it's crucial to be proactive whenever an issue appears.\n\nInstead of hiding behind a customer support number, reach out to all of your affected users as soon as a problem appears. Let them know what's happened, how it'll affect them, and most importantly of all, what you're doing to solve it. This way, problems don't have to be disastrous for customer-business relations.",

    "description": "The most common reason cited for a customer ceasing to use a product or service isn't that they have a major problem. In 70% of cases they leave due to receiving poor quality of service.\n\nInvolving users in product development isn't just a great way to build an exceptional product that your users need, but it also makes them feel more involved. Long term that's only good for business, both in terms of retaining more customers and increasing their average spend.\n\nTools like UserVoice are great for encouraging customers to contribute to customer development, just make sure you respond to requests and engage with anyone that comments.",
