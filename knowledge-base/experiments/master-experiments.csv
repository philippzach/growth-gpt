#,Tactic,Description/Hypothesis,Funnel Step,Probabiliy of Success,Business Type,Effort,Dev needed
1,Monopolize Search Ads,"If your products are available on other sites, consider using Google Search Ads to send visitors to them beyond your own site. This way your brand captures more real estate in the search results, which means higher CTR (3 top ads in the screenshots are Casper's too).",Awareness,High,"Transactionial, SaaS, Collaborative, App, Media, Game",Moderate,No
2,Target Facebook Groups Members,"While it's not possible to target Facebook group members with ads directly through ads manager, there are two workarounds: #1Join the group you want to targetUsing your business page, create a video that's relevantand valuable to the group audience Share the video in the group (go to video -> share -> share in a group) (from your personal account) Create a custom audience of people that interacted with it. Target the custom audience with ads #2 Contact the group admin and ask if they're willing to sell access to any of the custom audiences they've builtaccess to any of the custom audiences they've builtbased on their group members. Here's how it can be https://www.facebook.com/business/help/49929066382",Awareness,High,,Moderate,No
3,Quiz to Help Choose a Product,If you're e.g. selling one type of product in several configurations - help visitors choose the right option using a quiz. Not only they will easier find what they are looking for but also they'll be more convinced that they are making the right choice for their needs.,Activation,High,,Moderate,Yes
4,Interactive Sizing Guides,"Good sizing guides help greatly reduce the number of returns and increase conversion rates, yet are often neglected. The more accurate they are, the better for your business metrics.
You can take a regular sizing chart a step further, and offer interactive guides which are a better experience for shoppers.
A couple of considerations to make them as accurate as possible:
- use brand-specific guides
- display sizing info only for the specific item being viewed to avoid any confusion
- display the sizing guide link in a clearly visible location
- show info on how other customers rate the sizing of a given item e.g. 'fits larger than expected'
Example tools: www.fitanalytics.com/fit-finder, www.boldmetrics.com, www.tangiblee.com",Activation,Medium,,Moderate,Yes
5,Birthday Ads,"Target your ads to people with birthday/friends of people with birthday soon. Surprise them with a celebratory copy, image and a special offer just for them. This is an evergreen campaign - the audience is dynamic, meaning
- you won't have any ad frequency issues. This tactic is proven to work especially well for brick and mortar businesses.",Awareness,Medium,,Low,No
6,Tunnel Checkout,Remove header and footer from checkout to create a distraction-free 'tunnel'. Reducing the number of options a user has will increase the chance they will perform the action you want them to take and proceed further in the checkout process.,Activation,High,,Low,Yes
7,Bid on Competitors' YouTube Videos,"Grab the attention of users watching YouTube videos about your competitors using in-stream ads.
Google lets you hyper-target your ads to specific videos, which makes it a perfect opportunity to capture some of your competitors' potential or existing users.
With in-stream ads, you can show your ad before, during, or after your competitor's video.
There are two types of in-stream ads you can choose from:
- Skippable ads - after 5 seconds, the viewer can skip the ad, so it's crucial that you make the beginning engaging enough that users will continue to watch it past the 5 seconds point. The cool thing about this ad type is that you only pay when a viewer watches at least 30 seconds of your video (or the full duration of the video if it's shorter than 30 seconds) or interacts with your  video, whichever comes first.
- Non-skippable ads - users don't have an option to skip the ad, but you pay for all impressions it gets.
To capture even more real estate with your ads, you can reach users at an earlier step - when they're searching for a video. Using video discovery ads, your banners will show up on YouTube search results pages. Clicking the ad will drive users to your video.",Awareness,High,,Low,No
8,Auto-Display Cart Content on Return Visit,"Increase the conversion rate of users who add products to cart but don't complete their purchase in a given visit to your store by displaying cart content on their next visit. This way they won't forget about it plus, you can add a custom message with a discount if they checkout in the next e.g. 10 minutes.",Activation,Medium,,Moderate,Yes
9,Don't Force Account Creation,"Forcing users to create accounts during checkout is a sure way to cause a significant drop-off. Instead, offer a guest checkout option and create an account for them using the data that you collect during checkout.
35% of users will abandon the checkout if a retailer does not offer guest checkout.",Activation,High,,Moderate,Yes
10,Bid on Competitors' Phrases,Bidding on your competitors' brand keywords suggesting users are experiencing issues with their product (e.g. [competitor's name] + help/support/contact etc.) is a great way to get in front of an audience that may be happy to consider other products. Drive the traffic to a landing page comparing your competitor's product against yours and explaining why it's worth making a switch.,Awareness,High,,Low,No
11,Place Your Product in Stock Photos,"Use your lifestyle product photos (or arrange a photoshoot) and put them on stock photo websites like Unsplash or Pexels. People will download them and use them in their content, giving your products free exposure.
While the stock websites recommend people give credit and link back to the authors' websites, most don't do it. Find all websites using your photos, reach out to them, and ask for a backlink to your site.

12,Donʼt Bundle Products with Marginally Different Prices,"Known as presenter's paradox, the value of bundled items get averaged, not added. So when you're selling a
$1,999 laptop and bundle it with a $19 mouse, the mouse
reduces the perceived value to $1,009 ($1999 + $19 divided by 2).
How to do bundling right:
- when offering items with different values, establish values of the individual items first, especially the more expensive one
- emphasize how the cheaper product makes the more expensive one better
- focus on other attributes than price alone e.g. durability
or comfort

13,Rule of 100,Give percentage discounts on prices below $100 and absolute discounts above that value. If you're using site- wide discounting use the $100 threshold for average order value at your store. This will increase their perceived size and make users feel like they're getting an even better deal.,Activation,Medium,,Low,No
14,Influencers Niche Rollout,Sponsor multiple influencers from the same niche at the same time. This will create an impression that your company is bigger than it really is because 'everyone' in your industry is talking about your product.,Awareness,High,,Moderate,No
15,Exchange Facebook Pixel Data,"To reach new Facebook audiences with your ads, you can exchange your pixel data with other advertisers. If there is a company that you know has a similar audience to you but is not a direct competitor, this could be a worthwhile tactic for both of you.
There are a couple of ways to do that:
- share the whole pixel data (details: https://www.facebook.com/business/help/27905999606 9252?id=2042840805783715)
- share an audience (details: https://www.facebook.com/business/help/49929066382 3687?id=2469097953376494)
- Perfect Audience is creating a marketplace for advertisers looking to exchange their pixel data https://www.perfectaudience.com/connect/",Awareness,Medium,,Moderate,No
16,"Delivery Date, Not Shipping Speed","Following the golden UX rule ""Don't make users think"", show visitors estimated delivery dates instead of the commonly used shipping speeds.
Use: “Arrives December 20-22”, instead of“2-4 day delivery”.
Why? Users have a difficult time assessing when they will receive their order when shipping speed is used. They don't know factors such as your processing times and if the delivery speed includes holidays and weekends. They have to do this math themselves, which doesn't help them make a decision and check out.
For Shopify stores, you can even use an app to help you: https://apps.shopify.com/omega-estimated-shipping- date",Activation,Medium,,Low,Yes
17,Create a Ritual Around Your Product,"Create a ritual around using a product to increase user satisfaction and willingness to pay.
The ritual (e.g. a specific series of movements or behaviors) creates the feeling that the product is part of something we created. And humans value more what we create ourselves, also known as the 'IKEA effect'.
Ritual examples:
- Oreo: separating and licking the biscuits.
- Jeep: Jeep drivers are required to wave to other Jeep drivers, the so-called 'Jeep Wave'.
The ritual is most powerful when performed before the product is consumed and performed by the person consuming it e.g. the person opening and pouring a bottle of wine will likely enjoy it more than others she's drinking it with.
Another benefit is that rituals help create habits, which help retain users.

18,Subscriptions,"Add a subscription option and allow customers to get your products at regular intervals at a better price.
Especially relevant for replenishable products such as coffee, groceries, cosmetics, baby products.",Activation,Medium,,Moderate,Yes
19,As Seen In' for Credibility,"If you're a relatively unknown brand, you need some credibility to make visitors comfortable spending money with you. Use some of the publication logos you've appeared in as an 'As Seen In' section.
If you haven't been featured anywhere yet, you can hack it by using a paid newswire service that guarantees placement in a few online outlets. Just choose the cheapest one as it's not worth much.",Activation,Medium,,Low,No
20,Category Descriptions for SEO,"Help category pages rank better in search engines by adding category descriptions at the bottom of your pages. These pages don't contain much relevant text naturally, so adding a couple of additional keyword- optimized paragraphs can be of much help.",Awareness,High,,Low,No
21,Customize Website For New Visitors / Customers,"Align website content to visitor type. E.g. why would you be offering your existing customers to sign up to your newsletter if they're already on your list? Change this to
e.g. a referral prompt.",Activation,High,,Moderate,Yes
22,Product Videos,"- Viewers are anywhere from 64-85% more likely to buy after watching a product video.
- Over 60% of consumers watch product review videos before making a purchase.
- Product videos help explain products better and answer users' questions.
- Video viewers also stay longer on site.
You just can't go wrong with product videos. So if you can afford them, use them.",Activation,High,,Moderate,No
23,Cause-Based Incentives,"For each purchase, we donate $10 to charity X'. Make sure to choose a charity that's close to your target audience's interest.",Activation,High,,Low,No
24,Decrease Number of Form Fields,"20-30% of users abandon orders due to the checkout process being too long or too complicated.
Best performing e-commerce sites have 6-8 fields, while the average checkout flow has even 14-15 form fields - way too many.
How you can make your forms shorter:
1. Use a full name field, lose the title
2. Make the shipping address the default billing address
3. Collapse address line 2 & company name behind a link",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
25,Resend Emails to Non-openers with New Subject Lines,"48hrs or so after the first send, resend your email to non-openers with a changed subject line. There's no need to write a whole new email content if your email was not even opened.",Awareness,,,Low,No
26,Shipping Cost on Product Details Page,"A large part of shoppers look for shipping costs as early as on the product details page. Not displaying this info will make them wander to other parts of your store in search of this cost. This not only is not a perfect user experience but also makes the customer journey longer.
Instead, show the minimum shipping cost on the product details page by default. If the shipping cost is significant and depends on multiple conditions, use an expandable cost calculator.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
27,The 'Ugly Brother' Effect,"Add a slightly ""uglier"" (less valuable, less beautiful) version of your main product/service for the same price. Users will view the base product as more attractive and will be more willing to choose it.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
28,Anti-Ad Copy,"Tell users *not* to buy your product. Stand out from all other advertisers who talk about how great their product is. E.g. ""Grammarly? But I no how to right correclty.""",Awareness,,,Low,No
29,Next Day Delivery Notification,Add an element of urgency to your product pages to motivate users to complete an order sooner. Show till what time they have to check out to receive their order by the next day.,Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
30,Donʼt Make Users Confirm Account Information,"Adding email and password confirmation fields to your signup forms means extra fields to fill in therefore it takes extra time to complete sign up. Which of course lowers conversion rate.
Instead, implement a password field unmasking option so that users see what they're typing.",Activation,,,Low,No
31,Search Autocomplete,"Adding or improving (autocomplete) on a search box will increase the average search length by 1.6 words (from 1.7 to 3.3) (Nachoanalytics data). Having good auto- complete changes what gets searched, making the searches more specific and relevant. And by making the searches more specific, the quality of the search result becomes better, making people more likely to click on them. So as search length increases so does the conversion rate.
You can track the quality of your search results performance by measuring the CTR from your search results page.
Tool: https://try.sajari.com/",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
32,Reach Journalists with Facebook/Twitter Ads,"Very often, journalists may be hard to reach by email. Try to target them with Facebook (by job title) or Twitter (by handle) ads instead.",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
33,Don't Redirect on Add to Cart,"After clicking the 'Add to cart' button, don't redirect users to cart automatically but show a modal with 3 options and let them decide:
- continue shopping
- view cart
- checkout directly",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
34,Contest Consolation Prize,"After taking part in a contest and not winning, offer a discount to all participants as a thank you.",Awareness,,,Low,No
35,OR' Filters,"Allow users to combine multiple filtering values of the same type. E.g. multiple colors of the same shirt at once or two value ranges at once.
Not enabling this option creates a really bad experience for shoppers who need to go back and forth when choosing products. And more time needed to select a product means higher drop-off.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
36,Add to Wishlist,"Allow visitors to add products they like to a wishlist if they aren't ready to buy yet.
Don't make them create an account to save a product  but try to get their email anyway by explaining how they'll benefit e.g. they'll get notified when the price drops.
If they do create an account, use this opportunity to remind them about the products on their wishlist when
e.g. their price drops, or a holiday special approaches.
Also, you can make the lists sharable and make users share them with friends/family and turn others into customers.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
37,Alternative Payment Methods,"Allow visitors to pay using other payment methods than credit card and PayPal. Apple Pay, Google Pay, Alipay, WeChat Pay are some of the alternative payment methods you may want to consider to help improve your conversion rates at checkout.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
38,Top-Aligned Form Labels,"Always place labels above form fields. This way, when a user starts typing, she still sees what should be entered even after getting an error or returning to type after getting distracted.
It is especially relevant on mobile devices",Activation,,,Low,Yes
39,Move Subdomains to Subdirectories,"Get more SEO juice from Google by moving your blog from subdirectory to subdomain i.e. blog.website.com -> website.com/blog
Moz found that by structuring your site with subdomains, you may confuse search engines. Also, you will separate a large portion of keywords under the subdomain and dilute backlink strength.
When does using subdomains make sense? When each subdomain functions as a separate entity within the overall corporation. Disney, for example, has cars.disney.com, videos.disney.com, disneyparks.disney.com, princess.disney.com, and each one serves a very different purpose. Backlinks to each of them won't dilute the topical focus of the site.",Awareness,,,Moderate,Yes
40,Auto-Applied Discounts,"Apply any discounts users have automatically and show it explicitly on product details pages.
First benefit is that it removes some friction - users don't have to apply the code manually. The second is that after spending some time browsing your site, a user may simply forget about the promo code and not use it.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
41,Show All Product Gallery Images,"As a crucial element in the decision-making process, product images must be clearly displayed to users. Truncating the additional product thumbnails (e.g. by using a manual carousel) causes a large part of users to overlook the truncated product images.
And overlooked images is the same as not providing the images at all.
Possible solutions:
- Show product thumbnails in multiple rows
- Reveal all hidden thumbnails after enlarging the product image",Activation,,,Low,Yes
42,Create Video Ads at Scale,"Automatically create video ads based on your product catalog.
Connect your catalog, choose a template, generate videos at scale.
Tool: https://vidyou.co/",Awareness,,,Low,No
43,About Us Page for Credibility,"Build credibility (especially if you're a smaller brand) by showing that there are real people behind the organization. Put your employees' photos and bios, your company's physical address, and a photo of your office.",Activation,,,Low,No
44,Remove Automatic Carousels,"Carousels (or sliders) in the hero section of your homepage can be perceived as ad banner and ad banners are subliminally ignored. Also, too many offers in a short amount of time are too much of a distraction.
Instead, use user-initiated carousels.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
45,Prominent Free Shipping Info,"Clearly show that you offer free shipping. Charging for shipping is a conversion killer. At this point, the majority of companies offer some form of free shipping. If youʼre not offering free shipping, try to figure out a way you can offer it. Even though sometimes it might be almost impossible to make it profitable, there are a couple of strategies worth testing:
1. First, check the difference in conversion with and without free shipping
2. Test offering free shipping only from a given minimum order value
3. Test offering free shipping only on products where margins are large enough that it's profitable
4. Test increasing prices to compensate for the loss on free shipping",Activation,,,Low,Yes
46,DSA + RLSA,Combine DSA (Dynamic Search Ads) and RLSA (Retargeting Lists for Search Ads) in one Google Search campaign to broaden the reach while keeping it relatively low risk as you're targeting your past website visitors only.,Awareness,,,Moderate,No
47,Loyalty Program,Create a loyalty program that will reward your customers for buying more from you. Each purchase should bring them closer to a reward.,Awareness,,,Moderate,No

Tool: viral-loops.com",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
49,User Generated Content,"Create authenticity and trust towards your brand by using content created by your customers and use it to attract new ones.
40% of sites fail to allow users to upload their own images of products. This is a missed opportunity, as users consider user-uploaded images as being more realistic and trustworthy product representations, compared to the vendorʼs polished product images. In addition to allowing user-uploaded images, sites should actively solicit this free product content from users.",Activation,,,Moderate,No
50,Special Category Pages,"Create dedicated pages for special categories such as best-sellers and products currently on sale. Best-sellers make the choice easier for visitors, as people trust the opinions of other, similar people. As for products on sale
- there is a type of people who are always looking for discounted products and are much less likely to buy stuff at full prices.",Activation,,,Low,No
51,Life of Current Price,Create urgency by saying that the current price of a product lasts until X. People will feel the need to make a decision faster.,Activation,,,Low,Yes
52,Browser Elements Matching Your Brand,"Customize browser elements to match your brand style and increase user engagement.
Use these examples to customize the experience for your visitors: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design
-and-ux/browser-customization/",Activation,,,Low,Yes
53,Inline Validation,"Deliver messages to the user in real-time based on whether the information they entered in a form is correct or incorrect, instead of accumulating all errors and displaying them only after a user clicks the submit button.
This greatly improves the user experience. Make sure you don't display an error message before a user has finished typing though - it can be both confusing and annoying.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
54,List vs Grid View,"Depending on the product type, you may want to present your assortment in a different style - as a list or grid view. The way to think about it is which of the two will help users find the right product better.
Grid view is better suited for product categories where visuals are more important - clothes or watches for example.
List view is recommended for products where specifications are important and thumbnails don't help much - electronics are a good example.
The easier you'll make it for visitors to choose the right product, the more of them will buy from you.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
55,Auto-Select Credit Card Type,Determine customerʼs credit card type automatically based on the first digits rather than have users select it themselves. Easy to implement and removes one choice for the user.,Activation,,,Low,Yes
56,Facebook Messenger Newsletters,"Send newsletter in Facebook Messenger and leverage open rates and CTRs a couple of times higher than when using email.
Tool: mailport.io",Awareness,,,Low,No
57,Form Field Focus,Direct users' attention to the first form field by automatically setting the focus to it. Enhance this effect by fading out the background around the form. Users will have no doubt about what action they should take next.,Activation,,,Low,Yes
58,Run Promotions Toward the End of the Month,"Discounts are more effective towards the end of the month when the budgets of most people are nearing depletion.
Also, when we buy a product that exhausts our remaining budget, the negative emotions associated with spending the money are transferred onto the product, influencing its ratings. This phenomenon is called the 'bottom dollar effect'.
Youʼre more likely to buy a product (and be satisfied with it) when you have more money left in your budget. So plan your promotions accordingly.

63,Test Product Prices,"Don't blindly base your prices based on your competitors. Test it continuously by showing a different price to a different part of your website traffic - 50% of visitors will get price A while the other 50% will get price
B. After reaching statistically significant results, set the price that brings more revenue.

72,Segment Facebook Ad Sets by Country Tiers,"Facebook optimizes delivery to bring results at the lowest price possible. Having too many countries in one ad set will usually result in spending most of your budget in the cheapest countries (where cheapest conversions happen). This way, the more expensive countries in your ad sets won't get enough impressions.
E.g. country tiers:
1. US, CA, AU, UK
2. DE, NL, FR
3. CZ, RU, UA",Awareness,,,Low,No
73,Continue with Social Media Account Option,"Filling out a bunch of forms is even worse on mobile devices than on desktop.
Ease mobile users' pain by allowing them to 'Continue with Facebook/Google' and fill out some part of the required data automatically.
This is a low-hanging fruit to improve your mobile conversion rates.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
74,Sticky CTA Bar on Mobile,Fix the CTA button to the bottom of mobile screens to have it handy for visitors so that they don't have to scroll back to the top/bottom of the page. Making it visible at all times will increase the chance of them clicking it and proceeding to the next step in the funnel.,Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
75,Product Comparison by Default,"For products that tend to be compared with other, similar ones often, show comparison charts by default and save users the extra step of doing it by themselves.
Position the comparison as other popular products or products selected by experts.
Displaying comparisons automatically is a good way to display related items and helps encourage people to upgrade their original choice.
How to design the comparison layout to be most effective? Place your most preferred product (based on features, price, profit margin, popularity, and the rate of return) in the center.
Center-Stage Effect explains this - people prefer the middle option rather than the extremes when choosing from an array of similar options. They believe it's the most popular and well-liked by other consumers, so they follow the herd.

Tooltips provide a good user experience while not taking much extra space on the page.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
78,Exit-Intent Popups,"Even though everyone says they don't like popups, they still work and are a low-hanging fruit to increase your conversion rates and grow your email list.
Offer a discount, free shipping, or get more creative and come up with something special that your target audience will find valuable.",Activation,,,Low,No
79,Record User Behavior,"Use a screen recording software to watch how visitors move around your website. It's one of the best ways to spot elements that cause problems to users e.g. forms working incorrectly, buttons not working etc.
Tools to use: inspectlet.com hotjar.com fullstory.com",Activation,,,Low,No

81,Single-Column Layouts,"Form fields should be laid out in a way that allows users to immediately understand how to fill out the form.
Otherwise, users spend precious time trying to figure out the relationship among fields, or making errors with their inputs, instead of quickly moving forward in the checkout.
And multi-column form layouts are prone to such misinterpretations. There are multiple ways in which they can be understood (see screenshot).
Use single-column form layouts instead.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
82,GIPHY Branded GIFs,"Get more exposure by creating your own branded GIFs.
How to do this:
1) Create a GIF relevant to what your target audience searches for. Include your product/logo/website
2) Upload to Giphy with relevant hashtags
3) Create 5 GIFs and apply for a free channel (this step allows for your GIFs to be publicly searchable)",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
83,Welcome Discount,"Getting a user to make their first purchase is more difficult than getting them to buy from you again. Lower the friction to the first purchase by offering a small welcome discount.
Maximize the perceived discount size by following the 'Rule of 100' - give percentage discounts if your average order value is under $100 and absolute discounts above that price point. People will feel they're getting an even better deal.
Additionally, make it as easy as possible to apply the promo code - automatically applied to their cart on click if possible.",Activation,,,Low,No
84,Currency Localization,"Having to convert prices during shopping distracts the shoppers from purchase and leads to suboptimal conversion rates.
Let international users check out in their native currencies. Provide them with the localized experience they expect and improve your conversion rates.
Your best bet is to use a third-party software that will do it automatically based on visitor's IP address, as well as round prices so that they look natural.
If you're using Shopify, you can use e.g. https://apps.shopify.com/coin",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
85,See How Products Look Together,"Help shoppers visualize how products look together, increasing your average order size.

86,Display Prices in Small Font Size,"Human brain perceives prices to be smaller when they're displayed in smaller font size.
On your product detail pages, surround prices with other, larger elements. They will emphasize the small size of  the price, which in turn will make the product seem cheaper.

Test wording your referral call to action as 'give $10 to a friend' rather than 'get $10 by inviting a friend', as well as adding or removing the incentive for the inviting user.
Word of mouth referrals is something people do altruistically because we think the referred person will like it. Adding a selfish incentive (get $10 yourself) creates a contrast between the two motivations which neutralize each other.",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
88,Product Page Upsells,"If a product is often sold with accessories (e.g. hammer drill with extra battery and charger), offer an option to buy them together right on the product details page to increase your average order value.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
89,Automatic Discount,"If a user has an active discount for the current session, automatically reduce the price on the product page instead of only further down the funnel, on the basket page (fewer users get there).",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
90,Offer a Guarantee,"If you have a really solid product with very low return and complaint rates you should consider offering a guarantee.
Guarantees are effective when:
- users want what the company is promising
- users are nervous about the risk associated with buying the product or skeptical about your claims
- your service does live up to the claims you make
The best guarantees are worded positively. E.g. instead of saying “If you dislike our service…” say, “We guarantee that youʼll love our service.”",Activation,,,Low,No
91,Store Locator,"If you have physical stores, include store locator icon in header or menu to help customers find the location of a specific physical store and directly guide them to your products.
With about half of all mobile searches having a local intent, this feature will help visitors quickly find the physical store that's closest to them.
Shopify users can do it with an app https://apps.shopify.com/store-locator-9",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
92,Prominent Search Bar,"If you sell products that people know to search for, make the search bar big and prominent. If executed well, the conversion rate of users using the search bar will be higher than that of those who don't. Make sure the autocomplete feature works fine - longer, more specific searches return more relevant results, which in turn increases the chance of users clicking on them.
This is especially relevant for stores with a large number of SKUs.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
93,Customize Landing Page Based on Referral Source,"If you're getting a significant amount of traffic to one of your pages from a given referrer, it makes a lot of sense to treat it like a landing page for paid campaigns - customize it to the traffic source for highest relevance.
E.g. traffic coming from Noah Kagan's post -> use Noah Kagan's image and custom copy. Or, a more advanced example: add a section to the referral landing page that pulls stats from the referrerʼs usage of the product: “John, uses product_name X times per week to do Y. Heʼs saved Z hours/dollars using it.” (get an engineer to have the landing page automatically pull this non- sensitive data from the inviterʼs account.)",Activation,,,Moderate,No
94,Direct Competitor Comparisons,"If you're selling the exact same product as your competitor and you're offering a better price, show it explicitly on your product pages e.g. '38% cheaper than Nordstrom'.",Activation,,,Low,No
95,Search Spelling Corrections,"Implement Google-like spelling corrections and suggestions to improve search accuracy, which in turn will make more users find what they're looking for and increase your conversion rate as a result.
A tool like Sajari try.sajari.com will help you implement this and plenty of other improvements to your search experience.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
96,Star Ratings in SERP & Google Ads,Improve CTRs from Google search results and ads by implementing star ratings. Reviews = credibility.,Awareness,,,Moderate,Yes
97,Always Return Search Results,"Improve search results quality by adding an algorithm that returns product results without an exact match. Never let searchers see a blank search results page as it causes high exit rates.
Tool to use: try.sajari.com",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
98,Finger-Friendly Keyboard Type on Mobile,"Improve the user experience of filling out your forms on mobile devices by providing users the keyword type relevant to the current form field type.
This is a quick and easy fix but too often neglected.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
99,Before & After,"In a study of 70 campaigns with transparent sales results, Gallup didn't find a single before & after campaign that didnʼt increase sales. They work so well because they use 2 main drivers to persuade people:
1. Pain (people's current state)
2. Desired outcome (where they want to be)
Note that Facebook doesn't allow to use before & after images to promote diet, weight loss, or other health- related products. You are free to use them for all other topics though. E.g. 'Before using tool X, company Y spent 12 hours a week on finding relevant contact info. Now, the whole process is streamlined thanks to tool X and takes just an hour a week. If that employee's time is worth $50/hour that's $550 savings a week and $2200 a month!'",Awareness,,,Moderate,Yes
100,Referral Contest,"Incentivize users to engage and share your content by running a contest, where users are rewarded for each referral action with points. Participants who gather the most points receive access to your product or get prizes related to your product.
Make sure to give some small reward also to those users that participated but didn't get the main prizes. You can offer them a discount fon your product.
Example tools: viral-loops.com, vyper.io",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
101,Product Bundling,Increase AOV by offering a couple of products bundled together at a discounted price.,Activation,,,Moderate,No
102,Virtual Try-On,"Increase conversions and lower return rates by letting visitors try your products on virtually. Using their webcam, users can easily see if a product fits them.
Great for products such as sunglasses, hats, jewelry, or makeup products.
Tools to use: try.virtooal.com/en ditto.com",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
103,User Generated Q&A Section,Increase credibility and transparency by allowing users to ask and answer questions about products. They may have questions that you didn't think about that can be also helpful to others. Make sure to moderate them though or provide answers by your employees.,Activation,,,Low,No
104,Quiz in Exit Intent Popup,"Increase engagement with your exit-intent pop by using a quiz. Ask a couple of questions, then ask for an email  to send the result. The highest converting quiz popups are relevant to page content e.g. CXL on blogposts about analytics had a quiz testing visitors their Google Analytics knowledge; on posts about CRO - a CRO knowledge quiz.",Activation,,,Moderate,No
105,Facebook Messenger Marketing,"Increase open and click rates of your messages by sending them via Facebook Messenger instead of email. Open rates can reach >80% and click rates >20%.
What to use it for:
- cart abandonment reminders
- shipping notifications
- collecting reviews
- promotional emails
Tool you can use: recart.com",Awareness,,,Low,No
106,AI-Driven Product Recommendations,"Increase the performance of your product recommendations by using an AI recommendations engine that generates product suggestions resulting in more purchases.
Tool: https://www.depict.ai/",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
107,Accelerated Retargeting,"Increase the performance of your retargeting ad campaigns by adjusting the frequency over time.
The more time passes after someone visited your site, the less likely they are to click on your retargeting ad. How can you take advantage of this fact and optimize your retargeting campaign?
Split your campaign into 2-3 ad groups based on the time passed since users visited your site e.g.:
- ad group 1: high frequency, 2-3x/day for the first week after visit
- ad group 2: lower frequency: 1x/day for the next 1 week
- ad group 3: occasional: 1x/every 2-3 weeks
Remember to always take your average time to close a deal into consideration when setting retargeting frequency.",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
108,Easy to Compute Discounts,"Known as 'ease of computation effect', consumers' judgment of the magnitude of difference between numbers is influenced by how easy it is to compute.
This heuristic can make people incorrectly judge the difference to be larger for pairs with easier computations (e.g., $5.00 - $4.00) than for pairs with difficult computations (e.g., $4.97 - $3.96).
Conclusion: make your discounts easy to compute to maximize their perceived magnitude.

109,Finish Checkout on Another Device,"Let users complete the orders they start on mobile, on desktop. Add a 'Save cart to your email' option so users can be sure they won't lose the products they've picked on their mobile device.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
110,Self-Qualification Quiz,Let visitors answer a couple of questions (in a quiz form) about them or their needs and offer your product/service only if they meet the criteria. This way they develop trust towards you as you're not trying to sell them your product at all costs but offer a solution to their actual needs.,Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
111,Pricing - Decoy Effect,"Made famous by The Economist magazine's pricing page (they still use it, so it's been probably working well for them), decoy effect is a cognitive bias where people change their preferences regarding two options when a third, asymmetrically dominated, is introduced.
I.e. when there are only two options - people make a choice based on their personal preferences. But when offered a third option (priced a little lower than the most expensive one and/or with much worse features), they are more likely to choose the more expensive of the two original options.",Activation,,,Low,No
112,Respond to Negative Customer Reviews,"Majority of ecommerce companies don't reply to reviews left by their customer. This not only makes shoppers doubtful about the actual quality of the product but also about the quality of support they are to expect from the brand.
So replying to an unhappy customer won't change their satisfaction with the product they bought but will surely make an impression on other shoppers reading the reply that the company actually cares about its customers.
And this is something heavily underestimated by many businesses.
Also, make sure reviews left by your customer support team are easily distinguishable from those left by other shoppers.",Activation,,,Low,No
113,Invite from Address Book,"Make the referral process a seamless experience for your users by letting them invite others from all their address books like Gmail, Outlook, and others. Not having them remember or type their friends'/colleagues' emails will greatly increase the number of invites sent per user.
Tool: cloudsponge.com",Awareness,,,Moderate,Yes
114,Display 'Your Total Savings',Make your visitors feel like they're making a good deal by showing how much money they are saving by the discounts they used at the cart step. This will help you increase the conversion to the next step in the funnel.,Activation,,,Low,Yes
115,Maybe Later Option in Popups,"Make your welcome popups more effective by adding an additional button: 'maybe later' that turns the popup into a sticky bar (visible either at the top or at the bottom of the page).
Users who don't feel like using the offer right after entering your store - who want to look around first - might want to use the offer later on. But with regular popups, if they close them, the offer is gone.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
116,Prominent Sales and Specials Section,"Many studies indicate that about 50% of online shoppers only buy discounted products. Even though that may not be your perfect type of customers, that's a lot of your site traffic. Create a separate tab in your navbar menu and a section on the homepage to display your special deals to make them easily discoverable.",Activation,,,Low,No
117,Newsjacking,"Newsjacking is the art and science of injecting your ideas into a breaking news story so you and your ideas get noticed. If something's just been made popular, there will be lots of people searching for that topic.
Produce content on that topic to get it in front of these people, plus generate backlinks to your site.",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
118,Decrease Page Loadtime,Obvious but very often forgotten. This tactic is hugely effective and always works. Higher conversion rates. Better SEO. Better UX.,Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
119,Boost Your Article to the Top of Any Major Publication,"Online publications such as Forbes, Inc. etc. put their most popular content on top of their homepage making it seen by even more visitors. How to get there if you succeed in having your article published by one of these publishers?
Step 1 - create a Twitter post with a link to your article. We want to drive traffic to our article through a link from an organic source so that the publication doesn't suspect anything.
Step 2 - this one's crucial - grab the t.co link that Twitter
automatically shortens your proper link to
Step 3 - run ads driving cheap traffic to your article via the shortened link. How to get the cheapest link clicks
e.g. from Facebook? Target the whole Facebook network
without any narrowing and optimize for link clicks (of course) - Facebook will get you the cheapest clicks possible.",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
120,Cross-Sell in Order Confirmation Emails,Order confirmation emails are another good opportunity to offer your (new) customers similar products to what they just bought. All while their motivation is still high.,Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
121,Don't Make Forms Look Like Forms,"People don't like filling out forms. Make them look like they're not forms whenever possible. Use large, clickable images and toggle sliders to make filling them out more fun for users.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
122,Upfront Progress,"People feel a higher need to complete a task as it gets closer to completion. That's why some coffee shops give away pre-stamped cards with two stamps instead of one. On the Internet, show the progress users have already made as e.g. a crossed-out item on the onboarding checklist, 50% complete bar on the popup after only having clicked it etc. Just make sure that users feel the progress as soon as possible.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
123,Social Proof Next to Friction Point,"Placing a social proof element next to a point of friction decreases psychological resistance that your visitors experience when trying to complete an action. E.g. forms, CTA buttons etc.
Examples of social proof:
- customer logos
- number of users
- testimonial
- awards/certifications
- press mentions
- ratings from App Stores / user review sites like Capterra",Activation,,,Low,Yes
124,Content Repurposing,Use the content you already have and reach more people by distributing it on new channels. Turn your best performing text content into video/audio/slides/infographics and vice versa.,Awareness,,,Moderate,No
125,Price Partitioning,"Price partitioning means the division of a productʼs price into several components, provided that the components cannot be bought separately. Create an impression that the base product itself is priced reasonably but add-ons or upgrades can be bought additionally.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
126,Cost-Effective YouTube Sponsorships,"Partnering with influencers is usually not cheap but if you do some work, you can make it pretty affordable.
What you need to do is find undervalued creators (those with low subscribers/views ratio) who often don't do any kind of sponsorships and offer them a deal on your terms.",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
127,Add More Use Cases,"Products that are bought infrequently (e.g. once a year) are in danger of being forgotten about when the next buying opportunity happens. Companies selling them end up re-acquiring users, which is expensive.
The solution to this problem is adding more use cases around your product to stay top of mind of users.
For example, a user may need Patagonia's adventure gear once or twice a year, so it's easy for her to forget about them next time she shops for this kind of stuff and choose a competitor.
What Patagonia does to combat this is they create lots of adventure content on their social channels, that they invite users to after they make a purchase. This way, Patagonia stays top of mind as users consume this type of content frequently.
Of course, producing such content is not cheap. But for the long-term growth of products with infrequent use cases, adding another use case is often necessary.",Awareness,,,High,No
128,Justify Discounts,"Provide a reason for why you're offering a discount to establish it as ephemeral, which will make it more effective. Since the price is abnormal, people will be less likely to incorporate it into their internal reference price.",Activation,,,Low,No
129,Ratings Distribution,"Providing rating distribution rather than just an overall score increases credibility. Without it, shoppers may feel like the reviews are fake, especially if they're sorted in a way that all 5-star reviews are displayed at the top.
Make sure to hide it by default when not enough ratings are available.",Activation,,,Moderate,No
130,Prominent Contact Information,Put your company phone number (and email) at the top of the page so visitors know they can easily reach you if they need any help. It also makes you more trustworthy as you don't seem like you try to avoid contact with visitors.,Activation,,,Low,Yes
131,Geo Rollout,"When launching a new product, roll it out on all ad platforms one location/area at a time instead of spreading your ad budget thin. It will allow you to create an impression that your company is bigger than it really is because people will see your ads everywhere. This should be a more efficient way of spending your ad budget.",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
132,"Buy Now, Pay Later","Reduce your cart abandonment rate by letting customers on a tighter budget 'buy now and pay later'.
Options you can offer:
- pay later in full after 30 days
- pay later in 3 or 4 interest-free installments
- finance it and split the cost into up to 36 monthly installments (include interest)
Example payments provider that offers this feature: klarna.com",Activation,,,Moderate,No
133,Hover-Based Zoom,"Regular image sizes are not large enough for a thorough visual inspection of a product. For an optimal user experience, zoom images when users hover their cursor over them. This is a way more convenient solution than a click or icon-based zoom.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
134,ManyChat Comment to Message,"Grow your Facebook bot subscribers using ManyChat's Comments Growth Tool.
How does it work? When someone comments on your selected post, they get a message from your ManyChat bot. After they reply to it, they are enrolled into your subscribers list. This creates a new communication channel, one with exceptionally high engagement rates.",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
135,Cross-Promotion,Run a cross-promotion campaign with a company with a similar audience as yours but not directly competing with you. Seasonal discounts and referral contests tend to work well.,Awareness,,,Moderate,No
136,Persistent Cart,"Save users' products for their next visit so they can check out conveniently in their next session or on another device. This tactic can have an especially significant impact on users who research on mobile and purchase on desktop.
To make it even more efficient, display the cart content after users visit your site again.
On Shopify, you can use an app for that: https://apps.shopify.com/cart-persistify https://apps.shopify.com/remember-my -cart",Activation,,,Low,No
137,Remove Coupon Fields from Checkout,Seeing a coupon code field makes people (without coupon codes) wonder why haven't they received a promo code and others have. A part of them will leave your site in search of a code and never come back again if they don't find one. A good solution is to have the coupon code field hidden under a link that opens it on click. Just make sure it's not too explicit.,Activation,,,Low,Yes
138,Testimonial Carousel Ads,"Testimonials and case studies are the perfect type of content for retargeting ads - when users are familiar with your product and just need that little push to convert.
Carousels are a perfect ad format to showcase them e.g. each carousel card shows a case study from a different industry.",Awareness,,,Low,No
139,Leverage New Platform Features,"This is a rather general tip. When a social network introduces a new feature (e.g. Facebook Live, LinkedIn's embedded slides), it will increase the reach of posts using these features in order to drive adoption. Don't miss out and always test the new features.",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
140,Location-Based Delivery Times,"Show the best delivery time for each visitor by running an IP address lookup, matching it to your stores, then checking the ERP system for inventory. E.g. “Add another
$39 to your order and get your order 48 hours faster!”",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
141,Shipping Costs on Cart Page,"Show the shipping costs right on the cart page to avoid users leaving the page to search for this info elsewhere. If you have multiple shipping options, show the 'starting from' cost.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
142,Progress Bar at Checkout,"Show visitors how close they are to completing their order and reduce cart abandonment rates using a progress bar.
20-30% of cart abandonments are caused by long and complicated checkout process. Of course, the first step should be to make it easier and shorter. But then, to optimize it further, use a progress bar.",Activation,,,Low,No
143,Ads Dayparting,"Some businesses shouldn't run ads at certain times of day e.g. at night - even if you get cheap clicks, these users will often not convert.
Dayparting is about scheduling ad campaigns to run at certain (most efficient) times of day or days of the week. Check how your ads convert and how much they cost at diffferent times of day and adjust your campaign settings accordingly.",Awareness,,,Low,No
144,View Competitor's Best Selling Products,View your competitor's Shopify store's best selling products by adding /collections/all?sort_by=best-selling to the end of URL.,Awareness,,,Low,No
145,Search Instead of Dropdown,"Some form input types with lots of possible choices (e.g. country) should never be displayed as dropdown menus.
It takes way more time for users to find the right value, which increases the chance of checkout abandonment.
As a general rule, if an input has:
- fewer than 4 options - use radio buttons
- between 4 and 10 - use dropdown
- more than 10 options - use a search with autocomplete",Activation,,,Low,Yes
146,Pricing Localization,"Starting from simple changes like converting prices to local currency, you should make sure your pricing is adjusted to the main regions you do business in.
Two types of localization:
1. cosmetic localization - converting price to local currency, translating your website to more languages
2. true market localization - pricing based on market saturation and willingness to pay
Remember - different regions have different willingness to pay, so your pricing approach should mirror that.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
147,Use Thank You Pages for Secondary Action,"Take advantage of users' peak motivation and offer them something of value or make an additional ask. Examples:
- upsell
- invite to webinar
- most popular blogposts
- social follow
- social share",Activation,,,Low,No
148,Syndicated Reviews,Take reviews of the products you sell from manufacturers' websites and use them on your website before you get enough of your own ones.,Activation,,,Low,No
149,Progressive Fields,"Test showing form fields progressively - only after filling out the previous one, another one shows up, This helps ease the feeling of having to fill out long forms. On the other hand, it may frustrate some part of users as they might think they're done with submitting their info when another field shows up. Test it first before implementing permanently.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
150,Emphasize Wide-Appeal Products,The goal of the homepage is to get people off of it and move them further down the funnel. How to do it most effectively? Show them the most popular products and best deals first (provided you don't have any data to personalize the homepage specifically for them). This increases the CTR to product pages.,Activation,,,Low,Yes
151,Sort by Popularity by Default,"The items at the top of a list are more likely to be clicked, so make them your best-selling products to increase your conversion rate.",Activation,,,Low,No
152,Upsell on Thank You Page,"This is a moment when users' motivation is high. They've also already developed a certain level of trust by converting for the first time. That's why they're more likely to take another action now. Or, refer a friend. Plus, you already have their contact info, so they don't have to input it again to convert once more. This tactic leverages what's called a 'yes ladder', or 'foot in the door' technique. Once someone says 'yes' once, they're more likely to say 'yes' once more.",Activation,,,Low,No
153,Trust Seals at Checkout,"Trust seals make customers feel more comfortable handing over their sensitive information to you and increase your conversions. In general, the less known your brand is, the more of an impact they will have. Go for the badges that you think your visitors will be most familiar with.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
154,Formatted Credit Card Form Field,"Typing 16 digits in a row often results in errors. Help users prevent that when inputting their credit card number by formatting this form field into four 4-digit groups separated by spaces (as on physical cards) or dashes. Or other formats based on the detected credit card type (e.g. 4-6-5 for AMEX).
This is a simple tweak that can decrease your checkout abandonment rate by decreasing the number of typos users make.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
155,Product Size References,"Unlike in a brick and mortar store, evaluating product size online is difficult. And for some types of products, having a reference for how large a product is is very helpful for making a buying decision.
Placing a human or an object of known size next to the product as a reference point helps shoppers envision it's real size.",Activation,,,Moderate,No
156,Urgency Elements,"Urgency is a powerful motivator if done well. There are 3 ways to create urgency:
- Quantity limitations (e.g. only 3 products left at this price)
- Time limitations (e.g. discount until July 1st)
- Contextual limitations (e.g. Fatherʼs Day is coming, get a gift now)",Activation,,,Low,Yes
157,Show Details' Instead of 'Buy Now',Use a 'softer' call to action on product category pages so that users won't think they'll be adding a product to cart but moving to a product details page.,Activation,,,Low,No
158,Address Autocomplete,"Use a third-party service such as Google Maps API to pull city & state based on postal code entered by the user. The fewer form fields users have to fill, the better for your checkout conversion rate.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
159,Badges,"Use badges such as 'Best Seller', 'New Arrival', 'Staff Pick' etc to incentivize users to view details of the selected products.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
160,Personalized User Experience Using ML,"Use machine learning models to create more relevant user experience across the whole customer journey.
Examples:
- offer personalized discount codes only to undecided users
- retarget users with the highest intent to buy
- ML-enhanced product recommendations
- personalize landing pages based on user intent
Tool: https://morphl.io/",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
161,Stars Rating in Ad Description,Use stars and the number of reviews your product/service has to build credibility with your audience.,Awareness,,,Low,No
162,Show Related Products with Higher Prices,Use the anchoring effect to your benefit by displaying related products that are priced higher than the product users are viewing.,Activation,,,Low,No
163,Shareable Wishlists,"Let users share their wishlists publicly and make them pull other people to visit your store.
This tactic works best when users create a wishlist of items they'd like to get for an occasion such as Christmas, wedding, or birthday.
Encourage users to share their wish lists on social media, via email or text.",Awareness,,,Moderate,Yes
164,FAQ Section,"Use the FAQ section to answer any questions your users may have when considering a purchase. It's better for the FAQ section to be too long than too short.
Use all your conversation data (from email, livechat, in- person) to make sure visitors are not left with any hesitations before buying your products.",Activation,,,Low,No
165,Benefit Bar,"Use the space near the top of the page to display the benefits you offer to shoppers like delivery, warranties, promotions etc.",Activation,,,Low,No
166,Happy Birthday' Reactivation Email,"Use this tactic as a final attempt to bring inactive users back. It relies on the same logic as Birthday Paradox - in a room of 23 people, there's a 50% chance that 2 of them have a birthday on the same day. If you apply this to your email list, there's a big chance that a part of them just had, or will soon have a birthday. To target an even larger group of people, say 'Happy (belated) Birthday' in the subject line. Then just say that you're sorry you missed their birthday but have a special promo for them. It's hard to imagine someone reacting negatively to birthday wishes and a promo offer.",Awareness,,,Low,No
167,Review Mining,Use your most satisfied customers' expressions in your copy. Go to a website where you keep your users' reviews and copy some of the best-written phrases they used to describe your product. Your users will often have a better opinion on what your product is for them.,Activation,,,Moderate,No
168,Avoid Banner-Only Free Shipping Info,"Very often, the 'free shipping' info is available only in the site-wide banner at the top of the page. But because of banner blindness (people's tendency to ignore page elements that they perceive to be ads), this message is ignored by some part of users.
Instead, display the 'free shipping' info near the main call to action button on the product details pages, where it's much easier for the user to notice.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
169,Move Difficult Signup Steps to the End,"Weight of first form fields - make first form fields easiest to fill. Move riskiest, highest friction signup/form steps to the end of the flow to improve completion rates. The cognitive bias behind this tactic is called completion bias
- people feel compelled to complete a task once they
have started it. Human brain specifically seeks the pleasure completing a task brings.",Activation,,,Low,No
170,Where Should We Send Your Code,"When offering promo codes for visitors' email address, don't say generic stuff like 'sign up to our newsletter to get a promo code'. People usuall don't care about the newsletter part - they just want the promo code. Instead, make the offer only about the code and get their email by asking 'where should we send your promo code?'. This justifies your ask and makes users more likely to leave their email.
To make this tactic even more effective, arouse their curiosity and don't say what the discount is. They'll learn only after submitting their email.",Activation,,,Low,No
171,Virtual Outfitting,"When selling high-ticket items, offer shoppers a custom 1-1 appointment to help them select the perfect product for their needs.
Not only this will help you increase your conversion rate but also provide you with valuable qualitative insights straight from your customers.",Activation,,,Moderate,No
172,Cross-Sells in Cart,"When shoppers visit their cart, show them supplementary products to what users have already added to cart and increase your average order value.
Make sure these products are highly relevant to what they've added so far and test incentivizing adding new ones with small discounts.
Cross-sells work best when the suggested products are at least 50% cheaper than the originally added product.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
173,Allow Purchasing Temporarily ‘Out of Stockʼ Items,"When users find a product on your site that they want to buy but it's out of stock, they'll either look for alternatives on your site or will just look for it elsewhere.
If a product is regularly replenished, allow users to purchase it by increasing delivery time. Just make sure to communicate it clearly what the expected wait time is.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
174,Show Both Related & Complementary Products,"When users visit product pages, it can be for different reasons and from different sources.
Sometimes, they haven't decided on the specific product they need - that's why you should show them alternative products. For those that have already made their mind, suggestions of complementary items help them 'finish the look' and increase your average order value.
Showing both these suggestion types caters to shoppers at both decision stages, which is a win for your business.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
175,Breadcrumbs,"While often neglected, breadcrumbs are an important element of good user experience of e-commerce websites.
Without breadcrumbs on the product page, itʼs difficult for users to efficiently browse a collection of products as there is no way to go “one step up” in the hierarchy (to the product category), or return to a previous product list or search results page.",Activation,,,Low,No
176,Broad and Shallow Navigation,Your navigation bar structure should be broad and shallow (contain many items on a menu) rather than deep (many menu levels with few items). This helps visitors find what they're looking for quicker.,Activation,,,Low,Yes
177,Display Prices in Small Font Size,"Your prices will be perceived as smaller when they're displayed in small font and positioned next to larger elements. If you're using discounting, make the discounted price large to further enhance this effect.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
178,Use Negative Reviews to Your Advantage,"Turn haters into promoters. Take quotes from some of your negative reviews and use them in your marketing campaigns.
The key is to pick the reviews left by users who are clearly not your target audience.
Snowbird, a ski resort, used some of their one-star reviews left by unsatisfied skiers and positioned the resort as one of the most unforgiving and rewarding mountains out there (see screenshot). Nothing could be more enticing to their target audience than this.",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
179,Discount Progress Bar,Increase the average order value by displaying a progress bar visually showing how close customers are from getting a discount.,Activation,,,Low,Yes
180,Free Swatch Samples,"Offering free samples has multiple benefits and applications:
- Gather customer feedback about new products you're about to launch
- Reduce the % of returns
- Increase the % of repeat customers by sending samples of products they haven't bought yet
Why do free samples work?
Reciprocity principle - humans tend to return the favor. So when they get something from you for free, it increases the chance of them doing something nice in return, like making a purchase.
Also, being able to sample the product beforehand lowers the perceived risk of making a purchase they'll regret.",Activation,,,Moderate,No
181,Reduce Cart Abandonment Using Chatbots,"Don't wait until visitors leave your site to trigger an email cart abandonment sequence. Use a chatbot instead and save more abandoned carts than with email.
Trigger a chatbot when a visitor is about to leave your website (when their cursor leaves the tab) and engage them with the same offer that you're using in your email sequence.
Offer them a % off or simply ask for the reason they're leaving and let your customer support team take the conversation over.",Activation,,,Moderate,No
182,Transparent Pricing,"Build trust in your brand by displaying the cost breakdown of your products
Your customers will appreciate the honesty and transparency which will help you build broader relationships with them and ultimately increase your LTV.
Research shows that price transparency is effective at influencing consumer behavior when selling low-end products. Not only can it increase their willingness to pay but also accelerate their purchase.
Don't try this tactic when selling high-margin products as the size of the margin will not be received well by your audience.",Activation,,,Low,No
183,Interactive Content,"Increase engagement with your video and image content by adding interactive experiences.
Adding CTA buttons into your content is an unintrusive way of letting your audience shop right at the moment they are ready for it.
Making content shoppable will increase users' interaction rate and your overall add-to-basket rate.
Example tool: Spott",Activation,,,Moderate,No
184,Post-Purchase Email Drip,"Keep your customers' excitement about their purchase high by keeping the communication going until their order arrives.
The goal: by understanding the product better, they will be able to get more value and satisfaction out of it. This, in turn, will create higher-value customers over their lifecycle.
Example content to share:
Reiterate the fact that they've made the right choice by showing the reviews of happy customers. Make them feel a part of the movement/values your brand stands for.
Share the benefits of using your product on a
regular basis.
Show them how to use your product to get the most out of it.
Invite them to your community (e.g. Facebook
group)",Activation,,,Low,No
185,Comparison Charts,"Display a comparison chart showing the superiority of your product either over a competitors' product or the current solution your audience is used to using.
Comparisons vs current solution help visitors understand how your product can benefit them in ways they weren't aware of as they were used to a more traditional solution.
Comparisons vs competitors will help you convert users at the bottom of the funnel - those who know they need a product like yours but are still undecided on the brand. A comparison table makes this decision so much easier than clicking between multiple tabs. Can be especially impactful for products with comparable specifications (e.g. electronics).",Activation,,,Low,Yes
186,Product Infographics,"Use infographics to showcase key product features in an easy-to-scan way.
They're best used either as a product overview in the top section of PDP, at the bottom of the page to summarize what users just read, as well as within the product image carousel.
Just make sure not to overload the infographics with text. Use dedicated sections on the page to go into each feature's details.",Activation,,,Low,No
187,Tiered Cart Threshold Incentives,"Increase your AOV by adding tiered incentives to the cart.
Give users a reason to spend more by offering different gifts depending on cart value:
Free shipping
Free express shipping
Percentage discounts increasing with the cart value Mystery gifts e.g. cheap products
Brand swag
Real-world examples: https://kettleandfire.com/ https://misterjoneshealth.com/
Shoutout to Shane Rostad (https://twitter.com/shanerostad) for this tactic idea.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
188,Testimonials on Category Pages,"Increase the CTR from category pages by including customer testimonials within the product grid.
This will keep your visitors' motivation high by reminding them what your customers value your products for.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
189,QR Codes on Product Labels,"Place QR codes on your products to increase engagement with your brand which will result in higher retention and increased LTV.
You can use QR codes in multiple ways:
Sharing content enhancing the experience with your product e.g. recipes, tutorials, customer-only events, playlists. It engrains customers into your brand and encourages more purchases in the future. You can also change the content of the page that the QR code links to every day or week and encourage customers to keep coming back to see whatʼs new. Sparking their curiosity can help you establish a habit.
Cross-selling complementary products that improve the overall experience.
Re-ordering the product when customers run out of
it. Use an app like Repeat to let your customers scan the QR code and reorder the products in under 15 seconds without the need to create any accounts. This will also help you gather valuable data on replenishment intervals which will, in turn, let you better optimize your other lifecycle campaigns (email, SMS).",Activation,,,Moderate,No
190,Recover Failed Subscription Payments,"Reduce involuntary churn by sending automated messages to customers whose subscription payments didn't go through.
The vast majority of credit cards expire every 36 months, which means about 2.8% of your customers' cards will expire every month. This can lead to over 30% of revenue loss from annual subscriptions every year. The longer your plans are, the higher the chance of CC expirations preventing successful billing.
Another reason for failed payments can be mechanical failures of your tools. Make sure to review the connection points between your merchant provider, bank, and payment processor to alleviate any issues. These types of issues should be easy to avoid.
How to make the renewal messages (SMS/emails) as efficient as possible:
Remind your customers of the value they've been
getting from your product to make sure their motivation is high before updating their CC details Reduce friction as much as possible - include a custom link driving users straight to the payment update page with pre-populated fields
Tools:
https://churnbuster.io/ https://www.profitwell.com/churn-reduction- software (claims to recover >70% of failed payments) https://baremetrics.com/features/recover
The best thing about these tools is that you only pay for performance, so your ROI will always be positive.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
191,Founder Story,"Use a founder story to build a more personal connection with your audience.
People prefer to buy from other individuals and companies they like (Cialdini's liking principle), and whose stories they identify with because of similarities or shared values.
A good founder story should talk about:
The issues or challenges that made the founder start the company.
How the company and products answer these
issues.
What are the founder's and company's values. How the founder's life has improved after starting to use his own products.
Some example pages displaying a founder story: https://try.dyper.com/promo/halfbundle/ https://offers.kettleandfire.com/immunity -21/ https://shop.hopwtr.com/lp1/ https://get.magicspoon.com/miss-cereal-2/cb.html",Activation,,,Low,No
192,"Compare Your Product to Alternatives, not Competitors","Position your product not against competitors but against other ways your potential customers currently solve the problem.
A great example is Tenzo comparing their matcha to coffee instead of with other matcha brands.
The key thing here is to understand what the real alternative is that your target audience compares your product to in their minds. Most of the time, such a message resonates with a much bigger audience too.",Activation,,,Low,No
193,Post-Purchase Contest,"Encourage customers to share UGC content on socials by running a monthly contest.
Use the moment when your customers' motivation is at its peak (after they receive the product) and include an invitation to take part in the contest where they can win prizes by sharing their photos with your products.
This is a simple and low-cost way of incentivizing users to share on socials and a great way of collecting more UGC content that you'll be able to later use on your website and in ads.
Example (+ screenshot) from Manta Sleep: https://mantasleep.com/pages/napwithmanta (users are entered into a monthly contest and get a guaranteed 20% off of their next purchase)",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
194,Shipping Insurance Upsell,"Increase your AOV by adding a shipping insurance option to the checkout.
In most cases, stores don't dispute with customers when a shipment has been lost or delivered damaged. They simply send a new product free of charge.
Instead of providing such 'insurance' for free, make it an upsell in the checkout and easily increase your AOV by a couple dollars.
The more fragile the product, the more effective this tactic will be.
S/o to Shane Rostad for this idea.",Activation,,,Low,No
195,Coaching Service,"Improve the retention of your subscriptions by offering training/coaching services that will help your customers get more value from your product, faster.
The sooner your customers start to see or feel the effects of your product, the more likely they are to keep using it and ultimately develop a habit around it.
The support of a specialist such as a nutritionist or personal trainer will make them more advanced in using the product, keep them accountable, and accelerate the process of habit formation.
Aside from improving retention, coaching services are an extra value proposition that can also improve the conversion rate to purchase.
Examples:
Kencko (instant healthy smoothies) offers free 60- day nutrition coaching with a dietician
Tenzo (matcha powder) offers 1-on-1 training",Activation,,,Moderate,No
196,Delivery Cost Calculator on PDP,"Display a delivery cost calculator on the product details page to anticipate the doubt that a large part of   shoppers will have. Especially when selling bulky items or shipping worldwide.
Waiting to display this information until the last checkout step is not a good user experience, so the sooner users see it, the better.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
197,Offboarding Flow,"Add offboarding to your subscription cancellation process to save some of the churning customers and collect qualitative feedback from the rest.
This is one of the few cases where adding (a little) friction is actually a good thing.
Users subscribed to your product for a reason - remind them of the value theyʼll lose if they stop using your products on a regular basis (loss aversion bias).
Then, ask what's the reason they're leaving. Based on their answer, you can offer them a salvage offer and try to retain them.
Some example offers to try and make them stay: Downgrade to a less frequent subscription Let them pause their subscription
Give a one-time discount
Even if you fail to make them stay, such offboarding flow will let you collect some valuable feedback that will help you make the experience better for other users.
Based on ProfitWell's study of 1k+ subscription ecommerce companies, stores offering a smooth offboarding experience and salvage offers can save even 15-30% of cancellations.
Tools to create customized offboarding flows and offers: brightback.com
churnkey.co",Activation,,,Moderate,No
198,Post-Purchase Survey,"Use a post-purchase survey to discover valuable insights about your customers and the user journey of your store that will help you improve the experience for future visitors.
To implement it, add an extra step to your checkout flow by adding a survey right after users finalize their order. That's when their memory of the whole shopping process is the freshest and will result in the highest- quality insights for you.
For best results, use a single open-ended question. Some good examples:
What almost stopped you from completing your
purchase? / What is one thing you'd improve about our website experience? This question will help you discover problems such as fears and doubts that weren't addressed, checkout issues, weak value prop, confusion about how the product works, etc.
What made you buy from us? Ask this question to
learn the most important aspect of your product or brand that may be worth highlighting even more on your website and in your communication.",Activation,,,Low,No
199,Appeal To Ego' Copy,"Create persuasive ad and product copy by appealing to your target audience's egos.
Use copy that mentions the traits your audience likes to identify with because they make them feel good about themselves and look good to others.
How different products could use it:
Pela, eco-friendly phone cases: ""You care about the planet. Pela makes it easy to show it.""
Dog food: ""For dog parents who believe their pup deserves nothing but the highest quality nutrition."" Suits: ""Show off your confidence with the new
{company} suit.""",Activation,,,Low,No
200,Limited Edition Products OTO,"Increase your AOV by offering limited edition products as a one-time offer after users complete their purchase.
Users' motivation is at its peak right after their order so offering an upsell at this point is best practice.
To make the offer even more compelling, present them
with an opportunity to buy products that are not available anywhere else on your website. For example: new flavor, smell, color, material.
Triggering scarcity will make this offer hard to turn down
- mention these 3 things for best results:
It's the only time they will be able to buy these products
The offer will disappear after x minutes
The stock is limited and they can't order more than x products",Activation,,,High,No
201,Product Samples,"Include product samples in the shipment to: Increase the chance of repeat purchases of the sampled products (cross-sell)
Get feedback on new products before they're launched
Incentivize word of mouth by letting your customers share the samples with their friends. Make sure to mention the samples are specifically for their friends.
Product sampling is effective not just because consumers can purchase the full product with confidence but also because of reciprocity - in exchange for getting something from you for free, they feel compelled to return the favor.
To make the most out of samples:
Include an insert explaining why they received a given sample, along with product information and benefits. Treat it as a landing page.
Provide a clear call to action and include a QR code to let them easily order a full product (or leave feedback).
Include a special one-time offer and use scarcity to incentivize action.",Activation,,,High,No
202,Recommend Subscription Frequency Based on Product Usage,"Improve retention by suggesting to users the right subscription frequency based on typical product usage.
Picking the frequency that fits users' needs has a large impact on if they will keep their subscription active:
If the frequency is too high, they'll hoard too much
of the product and eventually cancel their subscription (or pause in the best-case scenario). If the frequency is too low, they won't have enough of the product to use it regularly and build a habit around it.
A simple way of solving this challenge is displaying a helper message near the frequency selector that recommends the subscription frequency based on how the product is typically used.
S/o to Lorenzo Carreri for this idea.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
203,Hero Image Captions,"Add captions to your PDP hero product images to make sure users focus on the features you meant to highlight.
While it may be obvious to you, it's not always so obvious to visitors what an image was supposed to emphasize.
Adding a little bit of extra context can make a big
difference.
Captions are particularly useful for close-up shots and images showing your products in real-life situations.",Activation,,,Low,No
204,Save Your Cart,"Reduce the cart abandonment rate by letting users save their cart contents for later.
Adding a product to cart doesn't always mean a user is planning to check out soon. Carts are also a form of 'external memory' used for storing products for later. This is especially true for products that aren't impulse buys and where users start their research process on mobile and finish on desktop.
So to let users easily finish their order at a later time, on a different device, or send it to someone else to pay for their order, a 'save your cart' feature should be implemented.
An extra benefit is that it also gives you an opportunity to follow up with such shoppers with an email drip.
An effective 'save your cart' feature in a cart must be: Easily noticeable
Clear how it works (users should have no doubt about what to do to finish their order at a later time) Low friction (no need to sign up or name the list)",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
205,Order More to Get More Gifts,"Increase AOV by offering free gifts for ordering more products.
The more products users add to cart, the more gifts they get. And the more products ordered, the nicer the gifts. A double incentive that makes this offer even more compelling.
To maximize the impact of this tactic, make sure the gifts further enhance users' experience with the main product.",Activation,,,High,Yes
206,New Communication Channel Incentives,"Gain a new communication channel with your customers by offering an incentive for leaving their phone number at checkout.
New commuinication channel means higher LTV, so offering something like order updates or even a coupon for their next order will be worth it in the long run.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
207,Discourage From Buying Your Product,"Discourage' users from buying your product to make them want it even more.
Don't be afraid of telling people why they shouldnʼt buy what youʼre selling. It boosts your credibility, shows confidence, and if the users are your actual target audience, this type of copy will increase their desire to buy.
Examples:
Supplements: 'If you expect instant results,
{product name} is not for you. But those who use it regularly for at least 3-4 weeks report significant increases in x and y'. Then, support the claim with a couple of testimonials mentioning the results.
Coffee alternative: 'If caffeine crashes are your
thing, you won't like {product name}. But if you try it once, we promise you'll never go back to your old coffee habit.' You can follow it with a money-back guarantee.
Non-alcoholic drink: 'If you don't mind hangovers after every night out, you don't really need {product name}.'",Activation,,,Low,No
208,Good-Better-Best Pricing,"Increase AOV by offering CPG products in tiered pricing tables.
This pricing strategy, called Good-Better-Best, is more commonly used in SaaS and its goal is to incentivize users to pick a more expensive option.
In ecommerce, it can be used to encourage users to pick more than one product by emphasizing the benefits of ordering more by:
Highlighting discounts
Adding labels (e.g. ""Most popular"", ""Best value"", ""Biggest savings"") to make more expensive options more compelling
And also, recommending the ""tier"" based on user type (in the screenshot, the household size labels reduce cognitive load and help users to self-select the tier that's best for them)",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
209,Process Transparency,"Increase credibility and perceived product value by making your production process transparent.
Making users understand what it takes to create your product makes users appreciate it more (which makes it more valuable in their eyes) and makes your company seem more trustworthy.
The example in the screenshot comes from Teabox's PDP.",Activation,,,Low,No
210,Price Justification,"Increase perceived product value by being upfront about why it's priced at a premium compared to other, similar products.
When selling commodity products at a higher-than- average price, you have to be explicit about what makes them worth their price to avoid any doubts in shoppers' heads.
Adding a separate section talking about just this aspect is a smart way of emphasizing your product's distinguishing features. Plus, it makes you look confident in its quality by being so transparent about it.
Examples in the screenshots come from Teabox's PDP and Dr. Squatch FB ads.",Activation,,,Low,No
211,Interactive Visualizations,"Use interactive elements to help users visualize your product benefits more easily and make them more memorable.
Here's an example of how Belroy uses this tactic on their collection page: https://bellroy.com/collection/slim-your- wallet
A couple of other use cases where this tactic could be used:
Interactive graph showing cost savings over time Showing the durability of a product vs competitor
e.g. how different leather products age
Interactive chart showing health benefits over time
S/o to Lorenzo Carreri for this find!",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
212,Effects Timeline,"Explain when buyers can notice what kind of results from your product in a visual way.
Displaying an image with an effects timeline lets you align buyers' expectations with what your product can actually deliver.
It's especially useful for cosmetics, supplements, and other health & wellness products where the results are not instantly noticeable.",Activation,,,Low,No
213,Custom Social Proof,"When selling wholesale to B2B customers, make the social proof more effective by combining the number of products sold with a notable brand that purchased it.
Ideally, pick a brand that matches your target audience closely.
Example in the screenshot from autonomous.ai",Activation,,,Low,No
214,Let Users Self-Qualify,"Instead of trying to convince users that your product is right for them, help them make that decision themselves.
People generally dislike being sold to. So if you create an impression that the choice is their own and they have control, they'll be more confident about their choice and satisfied with their purchase.
To create this feeling, show the criteria users will internally say ""yes"" to, like in the example from NoonBrew.
The self-qualification criteria can be:
Aspirational - based on how users want to improve their lives.
Persona-based - matching the characteristics of
your target audience (stage of life, personality, interests, lifestyle etc.)
Problem-based - mentioning your target audience's main pain points.
The goal is to make users answer ""yes"" to as many criteria as possible, giving them the impression your product is made for them.",Activation,,,Low,No
215,Word Picture Copy,"Make bland copy engaging and hold users' attention by replacing vague copy with word picture copy.
Painting a vivid mental picture of how your product will benefit your prospects triggers emotions, making your copy and products memorable.
To pull it off, use metaphors and similes to stimulate the five senses:
Sight: gleaming, tarnished, shadowy, sparkling,
dancing
Touch: velvety, icy, sharp, blunt Taste: bitter, zesty, refreshing Scent: musty, fragrant, sweet Sound: roar, sizzle, murmur
Word of caution: don't overdo it. Too much word picture copy can overwhelm the reader and diminish the impact of each vivid description.
Shout out to Nicole Bianchi who described this technique in detail here (using some great Scott Fitzgerald quotes).",Activation,,,Low,No
216,Display Bundles as Variants,"Displaying bundles more prominently on the PDP will increase the AOV.
Instead of showing bundles in the lower part of the page, move them into the variants section. They'll get more impressions which will result in more users selecting them which means higher AOV.",Activation,,,Low,No
217,Build Your Own Bundle,"Increase your AOV by letting users create their own bundle by selecting several items from a pre-defined set of products.
The Build Your Own Bundle (BYOB) tactic gives users a sense of control over their shopping experience which increases engagement and satisfaction with their purchase.
Here's how to make the most of BYOB:
1.  Use tiered cart threshold incentives (tactic #187) - encourage shoppers to add more products by offering gifts and discounts based on the number of items selected. The gifts' value should increase  with the cart value.
2.  Don't overwhelm users with too many product options.
3.  Display real-time status about their discounts and
benefits to keep their motivation high.
Here are some good examples: https://usehuron.com/pages/bundle-collection https://mateina.ca/collections/build-your-bundle https://us.fable.com/products/build-your-own- bundle https://www.drsquatch.com/pages/subscription- flow
There are a lot of apps you can use to implement BYOB, so pick one that works best for your product type and needs.",Activation,,,Moderate,No

224,Bing Ads,Import your Google Adwords campaigns into Bing Ads. Reach a different audience than Adwords.,Awareness,Medium,,Moderate,No
225,Integrate Facebook Messenger Plugin as opt-in,"By using a Facebook Messenger opt-in, you'll be able to retarget visitors more efficiently than email. 90% average open rates with messenger vs 20% on email.",Awareness,Medium,,Moderate,Yes
226,Reddit Ads,"As seen with Tripanner, Reddit ads could be your next channel with untapped potential. Create your Ads at ads.reddit.com",Awareness,Medium,,Low,No
227,Promoted Social Post,"Promote a social post to get cheap visits to a website and capture emails. High quality social posts can be targeted to reach specific audiences based on interests, shopping habits, browsing habits, and more. Publish a post on a social network and use their native advertising tools to promote it. Choose your target audience, set a budget, and watch the clicks and visits roll in.",Awareness,High,,Moderate,No
228,Facebook Call-To-Action,"Testing different CTA text options on Facebook Ads. Different CTAs can resonate differently with audiences. Learn More can be less pushy than Sign Up, etc...",Awareness,Medium,,Low,No
229,Twitter Hashtag Listbuilding & Targeting,"Hashtags can be great qualifiers for targeting, and this tactic will allow you to target events not listed under Twitters internal event targeting. To create a list based on a hashtag (i.e. for an event) you will need to: 1. Create a Twitter list (make sure you select ""private""; if relevant) 2. Create an IFTTT recipe, specifying the hashtag you want to track and the name of the list you just created. 3. For paid advertising, once your list is built, you can export it and then import it to Twitter as a tailored audience 4. Create campaign targeting the new custom audience",Awareness,Medium,,Moderate,No
230,Gender-Focused Ad Copy,"Products and offers are commonly advertised differently to different genders. Your copy should reflect this fact. Use gender targeting and create gender focused copy (and creative) to better engage with potential customers. However, be very cognizant that you are not perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes - which could lead to a PR disaster . Examples: “A rugged, strong truck for game day tailgates. You need this, dude.” “The perfect romance novel for when he falls asleep in his man cave.”",Awareness,High,,Low,No
231,Facebook Canvas Ads,"Facebook Canvas ads allow for a more immersive, media-rich experience in comparison to static advertisements. A major advantage of these ads is that they are opened inside Facebook as opposed to a mobile webpage creating a seamless experience with no load times. Functionality is also robust allowing for animations, product galleries, videos, and tilt-to-view images.",Awareness,Medium,,Low,No
232,Smarter Process Ad Copy,Messaging that communicates the way your product improves a companies' process is a great ad-copy tactic (especially in the B2B space). Communicating that you CAN solve the problem is often a higher priority than HOW you will solve the problem.,Awareness,Medium,,Low,No
233,Job Seniority Targeting,"Similar to targeting job titles, targeting seniority can be an effective way of hitting the right people in your audience persona. Make sure you talk to your current (and best) customers to see what job title they hold to inspire your targeting choices here. You should be careful to test this rigorously and review the leads you get, as we've seen instances of people posting fake job titles, which dents the reliability of this type of targeting. The most accurate job title data we've seen is on LinkedIn.",Awareness,Medium,,Low,No
234,Press Ad Copy,"Take advantage of the press your offer generates by mentioning media outlets that have featured your product. Incorporating well-known media outlets or news sources can bolster your offer’s credibility while also acting as a guidepost for people to conduct additional research. Utilize earned media to it’s fullest extent... because, you earned it! Example: “New monitor featured on TechCrunch.” “In the New York Times last week.” “Recently featured on MTV.”",Awareness,Medium,,Low,No
235,Value Proposition in Hero,Displaying product direct value propositions on the hero image is a great way to educate them on the value of the product.,Awareness,Medium,,Low,No
236,Social Proof CTA,"Using social proof as a part of your CTA adds legitimacy/authority, and people are more likely to follow a crowd. Find a strong and applicable quote about your product from a client or influencer and include it with a CTA button. This tactic can be effective for listbuilding, app installs, lead collection, etc",Awareness,Medium,,Low,No
237,Infographic in Image Ad,"Using an infographic in the image of your ad can drive performance. It’s a descriptive and visual way to depict what results your audience can expect when they buy into your product. Design a small, concise infographic for your ad and use it instead of your other images to see how it impacts your ad performance.",Awareness,Medium,,Low,No
238,Two-Sided Referral,"Try offering an incentive to users to refer you and for new users to join. This gives incentives to the person who shares (who benefits directly) and decreases anxiety for the person they share with (they also benefit, so they aren't worried about the person who shares getting an incentive).",Awareness,Medium,,Low,No
239,Anchoring Ad Copy,"Leverage the anchoring effect in your copy by creating an “anchor” that helps people make decisions without hesitation. People have the tendency to rely too heavily on the information that is first presented to them; take advantage of this tendency. Connect your offer with a specific price-point or a more well-known brand to give potential customers a frame of reference. Examples: “5 blades, only 1 dollar.” “50% softer than Kleenex.” “Laptops that perform better than Apple products.”",Awareness,Medium,,Low,No
240,Responsive Ad,"In today's world, users are viewing advertisements on a wide array of displays. Utilize the responsive ad feature within Adwords for running on the Google Display Network (GDN). Your ad will change to the size needed for placement, allowing for better readability and more conversions.",Awareness,High,,Low,No
241,Sponsored Reddit Post,"Paying for sponsored text or link posts can drive engaged traffic from niche audiences within Subreddit communities (there are over 800,000 to choose from). This hyper-targeted approach can breed a great number of qualified leads. (Tip: make sure you have a solid understand of Reddiquette before posting.)",Awareness,High,,Moderate,No
242,Notify Featured Influencers,"This is an obvious way to get more backlinks and social sharing, but most people get lazy and don't do it. Take advantage of the fact that you quote, reference, and feature different influencers in your content. Send them a quick email saying “Hey! We featured your quote/post/etc… in our blog! Check it out. Would love to hear your thoughts on the post.”",Awareness,High,,Moderate,No
243,Viral Referral Widget,"Add a widget to incentivize sharing post signup. If you’re already built a landing page that converts, take it a step further with a viral boost. Viral referral widgets allow you to offer rewards to users who share your website with friends in their network. Incentivizing people who sign up for your page to share it with their friends can quickly double your conversion rate without your company reaching out to anyone else.",Referral,High,,Moderate,Yes
244,Daily Social Posting,To increase brand awareness and acquire signups/users organically through engaging content through popular social media platforms.,Awareness,High,,High,No
245,Facebook Audience Narrow By Spending Method,"Facebook allows you to target people who based on their credit card spending habits. Narrow your Facebook ad targeting to focus on this audience. For example, if you have a more expensive product or want to tap into an audience of high-volume shoppers, you can target high spenders. Narrow down further by other demographic and interest categories to get an even more targeted reach.",Awareness,High,,Moderate,No
246,Short URLs,Using short URLs is a better user experience and there are indications that Google ranks shorter URLs higher than longer ones (all things being equal).,Awareness,High,,Low,Yes
247,SumeMe Image Sharer,"While many sites are utilizing tools that allow users to share text content, it is still rare for companies to include tools that allow users to share images. Image sharer solves this problem by allowing users to instantly share images on your site and link them back to you. Using Image sharer is an innovative and unique way to allow site visitors to engage with your content while also driving traffic to your site.",Referral,High,,Moderate,Yes
248,Target Audience Callout,"Call out your target audience to catch their attention AND qualify leads. That a double win for CTR! This tactic is useful if your target audience shares a particular trait, profession, or identity. (Note: have a comprehensive understanding of your target audience before trying this tactic.) NOTE: For Facebook Ads, make sure your callout does not assert or imply anything about a person’s race, ethnic origin, religion, beliefs, age, sexual orientation or practices, gender identity, disability, medical condition (including physical or mental health), financial status, membership in a trade union, criminal record, or name. See policy for details .",Awareness,High,,Moderate,No
249,Expat Audience,There are 92 million expatriates (aka expats) on Facebook. Engage with this substantial demographic using Facebook's robust targeting. Target expats living in certain countries or originating from a certain country.,Awareness,High,,Low,No
250,Host Live Video,Use Periscope or Facebook live to broadcast what you're doing in the moment and get highly engaged users. These users will be more likely to interact with you through the broadcasting platforms and you’ll be able to build relationships with them directly.,Awareness,High,,High,No
251,Outbound Linking,"Link out to relevant sites to prevent users who come to your site through search from returning to Google. Google considers a search more successful if after clicking on a search result, the user does not return to the search results page to select another link or create a new query. This is known as time to long click. Link out to valuable information sources so users leave your site on your terms rather than through Google, meaning an increase in long clicks and an increase in your search ranking.",Awareness,High,,Moderate,No
252,Stock Image,"Stock imagery can be a good neutral placeholder to test before you get hold of better proprietary pictures. Try to use images that look more natural and less posed, as these are likely to outperform photos that clearly look like stock photos. There are lots of stock photo sites out there with various prices from free to thousands of dollars per image.",Awareness,High,,Low,No
253,Twitter Lead Ad (No Card),"Try creating a lead ad without using Twitter's Lead Generation Cards, just using a link or photo instead. It feels less like an ad, so user will be less prone to skimming over it. Twitter lead cards are fancy and feature-rich, but they look like ads. Instead, try promoting a Tweet with an image and copy that you've found performed well in the past.",Awareness,High,,Moderate,No
254,Referral Promotion,"Referral programs can get lost in a site's architecture and potential customers may not be aware of an offer. By promoting a referral more people will be aware of it's existence and therefore more people will refer their friends. You can promote your referral program in many different ways: email newsletters, product update emails, milestone emails, in-app popups, directly on your landing page, in invoices/receipts, etc…",Referral,High,,Moderate,No
255,Free Trial Vs Demo Landing Page,"Offering a free trial of your product can be a smoother entry and more enticing offer than scheduling a demo. Try offering a free trial, and guiding those users into a paid account.",Acquisition,High,,Moderate,Yes
256,Finality Ad Copy,"Craft bold copy that exclaims the finality of your offer. People will no longer have to search for alternatives after finding your solution. Finished. Finito. Their problems will be alleviated and you will be the hero. Make your offer their final, indefinite solution. Examples: “The last razor you will ever have to buy.” “An ERP system to end all ERP systems.” “Stop searching for the perfect pen, we have the only pen you’ll ever need",Awareness,High,,Low,No
257,Like Video CTA,Remind your watchers to like your video - just this one action can increase likes by 2-5x. This will help your video spread to other audiences and get more views.,Awareness,High,,Low,No
258,Qualaroo Branching Surveys,"You can create surveys with branching paths based on how users respond. If a user says they don't like parts of your product, you can ask them for deeper feedback. You can get clever with branching surveys - a user that shows great interest in your content, for example, can receive an email capture prompt to sign up for a newsletter based on their answers.",Awareness,High,,Low,No
259,Appeal To Ego Sharing,"When a person shares, they’ll want to know they did something great, not just for their friends, but for themselves. Appeal to their ego by making them look good to their friends. Use landing page copy for friends they referred to remind them who sent them to you. Send a message to both users when a referral turns into a conversion. They’ll both be much more likely to share in the future.","Awareness, Referral",High,,Low,No
260,Rhyme As Reason Ad Copy,"As a marketer you have a solid understanding of why people are attracted to your offer. Spell out that reason by incorporating a playful rhyme. Put on your Dr. Seuss hat and rhyme your way to successful advertising. (Note: this can be difficult if your offer is oranges.) Example: “For that smooth shave you crave” “A new, energy efficient light for your delight.” “Visit a new shore that you are bound to adore.”
",Awareness,High,,Low,No
261,Keyword Only URLs,"Another SEO best practice for all blogs, instead of having random strings or the blog post title as your URL, use the keyword you’re trying to rank the blog post for as your URL slug. This both helps you have a clean URL that’s easy to understand for your readers, and whenever the link is copy-pasted, it acts as anchor text, which is great for retaining the SEO benefit of your link. Example: Instead of https://blog.ladder.io/144-actionable-growth-strategies-for-your-business/ We use https://blog.ladder.io/growth-strategies/",Awareness,High,,Low,No
262,Long Video Description,"Google can't ""see"" what's in the video, so write a long description for them to analyze to convince them to rank you higher for the right keywords.",Awareness,High,,Low,No
263,Guest Article Publishing,"Be open to accepting guest articles from relevant authors for publishing on your blog. You can manually recruit these people by offering a quid-pro-quo (offer to write for their blog) or just as a way for them to increase their exposure. You get free content without having to write it yourself, and the credibility of the influencer who published on your site",Awareness,High,,Low,No
264,Copy Best Adwords Ads For Meta Title / Description,"Leverage your paid ads to test best versions and roll out on organic. You gather a lot of data from the performance of your ads - how well they do with your audience, how many leads they generate, etc… That data can be used to advance your SEO efforts, since you already know what works best from your ads.",Awareness,High,,Low,No
265,Twitter App Re-Engagement Ad,Have users that have downloaded your app but dropped off the face of the earth? Chances are they liked what they saw but just forgot about your app. Re-engaging them with promoted app card ads that direct them straight back to your app is a great way to boost retention. Let users open your mobile app straight from a Tweet and watch as they flock right back to it,Awareness,High,,Low,No
266,Keyword In Meta Titles,"Adding the most important keyword you’re targeting into the meta titles of your page is a good way to increase organic search traffic. Prioritize the front end of your meta titles for the highest-importance keywords and make them relevant to the page content itself. Keep it short, simple, and easily readable by both individuals and search engines.",Awareness,High,,Low,No
267,Find Keywords In Conference Agendas,"Search through conference agendas to find good ideas for keywords. Conference writers and speakers want their content to be seen beyond just the conference, especially in the aftermath, so they'll consciously or subconsciously use keywords that will help them rank on Google. These keywords will help you generate content ideas.
",Awareness,High,,Low,No
268,CC Mentioned Influencers,"When sharing a piece of content that mentions an influencer on social media, make sure you copy them into the post. They might share it with their audience, increasing the reach of your po",Awareness,High,,Low,No
269,Top 10 List Placement,Create top 10 lists for products/startups in your industry and get each startup / product to push the content to their audience in return for being featured. This type of content is really easy to put together and can yield a high return on effort.,Awareness,High,,Low,Yes
270,Casual Photo Ad,"A casual photo - one that shows your product in action or in a natural setting without too much editing and staging - can be highly effective at increasing ad performance. This is because people seeing the ad get a view of your product in real-life, real-time use. You help them more effectively visualize what it will look like in their possession.",Awareness,High,,Low,No
271,Blog Banners,Create a wide banner graphic for each blog post and/or post section.,Awareness,High,,Moderate,No
272,Stickers & Wild Postings,"In highly concentrated urban areas, many eye-balls can be captured with a simple, well positioned sticker or poster. These low cost tactics are used by rapidly growing startups, particularly those whose customers all congregate in a specific area (for example many developer tools use this method).",Awareness,High,,High,No
273,Delete Low Performing Blog Posts,"If your blog post isn't getting much traffic and hasn't attracted many links, you should actually delete it as it could be harming your site's reputation.",Awareness,High,,Low,No
274,Larger Font Size,"Don't make your font size too small or people will bounce and that will hurt your rankings. This will help with time on site, which is a critical metric for better ranking on Google search.","Acquisition, Activation",High,,Low,No
275,Navigation Bar Keywords,"Change around your landing page’s navigation bar to only feature relevant verticals based on search terms. This can be based on search terms used to get to your site and ones that users employ in your native search bar. Use your navigation bar to point to the most important pages on your site, such as your highest-selling product categories.",Activation,High,,Low,No
276,Right Side CTA Landing Page,"Place your call to action form or button on the right side of your landing page to increase activation. Focusing on the right side of your landing page rather than the center, especially when the form remains visible while scrolling down the page, keeps registration forms and CTA buttons above the fold and easily accessible for visitors. This reduces friction between reading your marketing copy and signing up for a demo or free account.","Acquisition, Activation",,,Low,Yes
277,Being Direct,"Be direct with your landing page and CTA button copy. Rather than using flowery or roundabout language, get to the point quickly and authoritatively. This sends a clearer, stronger message to visitors that they should pay attention and sign up","Acquisition, Activation",,,Low,No
278,Rankings Social Proof,"When researching different products, services, restaurants, bars, or anything that involves a purchase decision, chances are you go to a recommendation site and look for the top provider in that category. Providing this information up front for your customers when you’re highly ranked in your industry can help you earn trust through social proof. Go for the most impressive of ranking lists to show visitors how great others think your products are.","Acquisition, Activation",,,Low,No
279,Selling Benefits,"Sell benefits instead of features. A benefit solves a higher order need and will convince a user to pay more. For example, you don't purchase a disposable camera because it's cheap, but rather because you want to capture memories without stressing about valuable equipment.","Acquisition, Activation",,,Low,No
280,Video CTA,Add a link in an annotation in your YouTube videos to click back to your email list signup or other CTA. It’s a great way to capture emails of prospects who saw and enjoyed your videos. Include a link to a promotion or sale in a video annotation and consider referencing it in the video itself with a graphic. Use tracked Bitly links to track performance.,Awareness,,,Low,No
281,Lead Custom Audience,Retargeting leads on social media based on a custom audience can drive them back to your site to convert. You can use your current customer list to generate a custom audience that you can then target with ads. This can bring your current customers back to your site to view and buy new products.,Awareness,,,Low,No
282,Offer Free Consulting,"Offer consulting for free along with a purchase of your product. It will let you get to know your target audience directly with face-to-face conversations, helps increase conversion, and will help you learn about what your audience needs and what challenges they face. Those learnings will help improve your product and marketing approach in the future.",Acquisition,,,High,No
283,Center CTA Landing Page,Putting a large call to action button in the center of your page can increase activation. The positioning will immediately draw attention to the CTA when someone lands on your page. Make sure the CTA stands out distinctly away from dense copy or complex images.,"Acquisition, Activation, Revenue",,,Low,Yes
284,Influencer Testimonials,Try adding testimonials from industry influencers to your page. Reach out to influencers that use your product or that you have a close relationship with and ask them to give a brief testimonial. People who know and value the opinions of the influencer will come to see you as more trustworthy. This increases social proof and therefore conversion.,"Acquisition, Activation",,,Moderate,No
285,Video Testimonials,"Adding a video testimonial can make your page look more professional and make it more engaging, increasing conversion rate. The content of the video is very important - take care not to make the testimonial look too staged or scripted. It should be as natural and honest as possible (even if that means the customer isn't being 100% deferential to your product).",Acquisition,,,High,No
286,Gated Content,"Gating your content behind a contact information capture form, whether it’s an email field, a full blown contact info form, or a landing page, is a great way to collect the information you need from someone before you give them the information they want. You can give something away up front and hide the rest of the content or entirely gate the content.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
287,Match CTA To Traffic 'Temperature',"Different traffic sources have different levels of intent to buy. Retargeted customers are much more likely to buy, so a weak call to action or too much information can actually convince them otherwise - you should go strong with a more forceful call to action. On the flipside, if a prospect has never heard of you they would need a much more gentle introduction and a softer call to action is necessary.","Awareness, Acquisition",,,Low,No
288,Benefit Buttons,"Instead of going with simple task-based button descriptions like ‘Register’, try going with something that highlights the benefit of signing up to visitors. For example, if you’re a productivity app, saying ‘Simplify my workflow’ rather than ‘Sign up’ can be more appealing and lead to higher conversion.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
289,Updated Content Page,"Sometimes you update content on a page that you've been using to drive conversions, but you aren't sure if the new content will perform as well as the old page did. The best practice is to A/B test new vs. old and see if there's a difference before switching it out fully. Split the percentage of visitors that land on each page and collect data over a few days to see which one works best.",Acquisition,,,Low,Yes
290,Adding Urgency,"You might add urgency to your copy. Urgency is a word that gives some people pause: of course it reminds you of a cheap voice-over announcing “Quick! While supplies last!” With that said, that if used correctly, urgency is a highly effective marketing tactic. Using implied urgency, adding a time-sensitive incentive, or mentioning the quantity of product available are all examples of strategies that can cause a jump in conversion rate.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
291,Quantity Social Proof,"Try listing the total number of people using your product to increase trust and therefore conversion. X many people can't be wrong! Try experimenting with a rolling number, a precise number or a number rounded up to the nearest hundred / thousand / million to see what converts best.
",Acquisition,,,Low,No
292,Eccentric Subject Line,"Don't blend in, stand out! An eccentric subject line is catchy and draws attention, increasing the likelihood that readers will open your emails. i.e. ""Green with Envy: Avacado vs Pistachio"" ""What your dog knows better than you""",Awareness,,,Low,No
293,Email To App Deep Linking,"Most email links send users to the mobile web version for a website. Deep linked emails, on the other hand, link directly to content inside of a mobile app, if that mobile app is installed on a user's device. This provides a superior end user experience, as mobile apps are typically faster and better-optimized than mobile websites. It also gives users the full featureset of a dedicated mobile app over the limited features of a responsive mobile site.

",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
294,Deep Linked Advertising,"Take users to the exact app content that is featured in an ad. Use deep links with your ads to make the user's journey from seeing your ad to clicking on it and arriving at a product page destination seamless. You can use this tactic with any ad platform, from search to social. The ad's landing page is as important as its copy, so getting users to the right page will help increase conversions.",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
295,Discount Popup Copy,"Test discount popup copy to see what level of discount is needed to draw your potential customers from consideration to purchase. You can try percentage-off, free shipping, BOGO, or any other discount approach.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
296,"Gazing Social Proof
",Try putting an image or photo of a person looking at the call to action on your site. It's a nice psychological trick to improve trust and draw attention to the CTA. It directs an arrow of vision directly at the part of your site you want a visitor to see.,Acquisition,,,Low,No
297,Less Choice,"Give a visitor less choice, instead of too many options. Too much choice can limit conversions: The more options you give a potential customer, the harder their decision-making process becomes. Barry Schwartz’s famous Ted Talk on the Paradox of Choice gives a great overview of how too much choice can lead to over-analysis and buyer’s remorse. There is an argument to be made that giving the customer a lot of choice can be freeing for them, but as with all solutions, the best approach is probably to rigorously test each hypothesis.","Acquisition, Activation, Revenue",,,Moderate,Yes
298,Checkout Lock in,Lock the customer in the checkout so the only thing to do is finishing the process. Remove Navbar etc.,"Acquisition, Activation, Revenue",,,Moderate,Yes
299,One Page Checkout,"Create a one page Checkout page, minimising the steps to conversion","Acquisition, Activation, Revenue",,,Moderate,Yes
300,"Swipe File Call To Action
",Offer a swipe file of best practice designs as your call to action.,Acquisition,,,Low,No
301,Daily Deal Promotion,Send your product out in a daily deal promotion on sites like AppSumo and offer a discount to members. This can drive thousands of relevant customers from app promotion sites that have a wide distribution.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
302,Useful Calculations,"Try useful calculations instead of asking to do math. Most people aren't able or willing to do basic calculations, so spelling it out for them can improve conversion. For example telling them how quickly they'll run out of credit, how long ago a post was posted (rather than just a timestamp) and how much they'll save from a discount (rather than a %).",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
303,Blog Purpose On Homepage,"Putting the purpose or theme of your blog explicitly in the hero copy on the homepage will set the expectations of your readers and draw them in to the content.
",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
304,Video Email Capture,"You can capture an email address at the midpoint of a video. Video Email Capture, also known as “Gating,” is a creative solution to make your videos interactive and generate leads. Basically, it makes watching, or continuing to watch, your video dependent on the user entering their email address. This generates very high-quality leads, as you’re getting an email address from people who have already proven themselves willing to commit to engaging with your content. Brightcove has a great explanation of how it works, and Wistia makes a great tool to implement it.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
305,Free Premium Trial,"If you have a freemium product, offering a free month trial of your premium offering is a great way to show your users what they’re missing out on. Without this trial, you can only rely on landing page copy and ads to do that work. Let your users experience your premium product instead - once the trial ends, they’ll see how much they got out of your premium features and will be more likely to convert.","Activation, Revenue",,,Moderate,Yes
306,Pinterest Style Blog,"Use a blog template that looks similar to Pinterest. This format can work well for blogs that intend to be image heavy, such as fashion or food blogs, but can work across industries if there's lots of high quality custom imagery.","Acquisition, Awareness",,,High,Yes
307,"""Snappy"" Subject Line","Stay short & sweet, and human. Grab people’s interest and get them straight into your email. i.e. ""TGIF!"" ""Need a hand?""",Awareness,,,Low,No
308,Sincere Subject Line,"Sincerity in an email subject line can activate users and customers that have been loyal or have dropped off your service. i.e. ""We can't thank you enough"", ""You're what makes us great"", ""Because we've missed you. Enjoy 15% off""",Awareness,,,Low,No
309,Last Day Of Offer Email,Be sure to send an email on the last day of an offer. People respond differently to a situation when urgency is introduced: we suspend normal thought patterns and react to the urgent need. A reminder that the offer they have the opportunity to take is expiring creates a scenario where they are forced to make a decision immediately..,Awareness,,,Low,No
310,Web To App Deep Linking,"You can use banners, interstitials, and links to send mobile web traffic directly to your mobile app. Try setting up links in your mobile site that deep link to the specific pages and products people want in your app. You can also create a full user journey from end to end that involves an app install. The biggest advantage here is that on mobile apps, users tend to convert and spend at a higher rate.",Awareness,,,Low,No
311,Profile Email Link,"Post a link to your email list signup form on all of your social profiles. You should make sure you're covering Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and even Skype. If you think about all the people you interact with every day who are seeing your profile, you can quickly get a good idea of how many passive signups you'll be getting just by adding a simple link.",Awareness,,,Low,No
312,"""Best Of"" Roundup Page",A page getting directly to the point with a roundup of your all time best products can drive an increase in conversion rate. Those products already perform well with your target audience and promoting them clearly is a great way to draw more attention to them and increase sales. Select your top 5 or 10 best-selling or most demanded products and list them prominently on your landing page to get the attention of interested visitors.,Awareness,,,Low,No
313,Video Description CTA,"Add a link in the description in your YouTube videos to click back to your email list signup or other CTA. It’s a great way to capture emails of prospects who saw and enjoyed your videos. Include a link to a promotion or sale in your video’s description and consider referencing it in the video itself with a graphic. Use tracked Bitly links to track performance.
",Awareness,Medium,,Low,No
314,Pen & Paper Email List,"At an event or in-store, have a pen and paper list and ask directly for people to sign up and fill out their email. It’s an effective low-tech way to get new sign-ups for your email list. It drives you to actively seek people out and make a face-to-face case for signing up.",Awareness,,,Low,No
315,Smaller Commitments,"Smaller CommitmentsThink about how you’re getting your opt-ins. Using a series of smaller commitments, instead of one large one, can be more efficacious, as it plays into a user’s sense of self-identity. For example, you could try asking small questions, like the old sales technique of getting a customer to start saying yes. Instead of just asking for a user’s email address right away, ask if they’re interested in looking around, then follow that with a prompt to see more content, then follow that with a request for their email","Activation, Revenue",High,,Low,No
316,Upgrade to Annual Plan,"After someone's been a couple of months on a monthly plan, offer them to upgrade to an annual plan and get x months for free.
If someone's been using your product for at least a year, such a decision should be a no-brainer for them. Experiment with the optimal number of months before sending the upgrade prompt (6-8 should be a good starting point).
Use email and in-app live chat to communicate the offer. Also, placing it near invoices and in your product's payment section (where they see the amount of money they're paying you) should be an effective way to convince users how reasonable it is to switch to an annual plan.","Revenue,Retention",,,Low,No
317,Reframing Discounts,"Instead of having two options for your subscription plan length - monthly and annual, test having only the monthly one and display the annual plan as an option to choose a discount (see screenshot).
This way, users are not making a choice between plan durations but between getting a discount or not.
S/o to Manuel Friger who came up with this tactic: https://manuel.friger.io/blog/how-reframing- discounts-led-to-a-4x-increase-in-yearly -plans/",Revenue,,,Low,Yes
318,Temporarily Unlock a Feature,Unlock a premium feature of your product to free tier users for a short period a time. Make them know what they're missing out on by not upgrading their plan. Two biases occur here: loss aversion and endowment effect.,Revenue,,,Moderate,Yes
319,Premium Features Visible for Free Tier Users,Show free tier users what features they're missing out on by not upgrading to a premium plan. E.g. place an overlay with an upgrade button over them.,Revenue,,,Low,Yes
320,Don't Log Users Out,"Extend the cookie length to some long period of time
e.g. 30 days and ask to authenticate (e.g. log in again) only at sensitive steps, like purchase. This will make more users return to your product thanks to removed friction.","Revenue,Retention",,,Low,Yes
321,Shorter Trial Length,"Based on Redpoint Ventures' data, free trial length has no meaningful impact on free to premium conversion rate.
Main benefits of having a shorter trial period:
- users will know they have less time to check out your product and be more proactive during the trial
- shorter trial periods mean shorter SaaS sales
cycles and lower customer acquisition costs
- youʼre able to conduct more testing, which allows you to learn faster and iterate faster
Note: always take into account the time it takes users to see the value in your product.",Revenue,,,Low,Yes
322,Switch to Value-Based Pricing,"Charge customers for the value they're getting out of your product e.g. per user, per dashboard, per 100 visits, etc. rather than for features.
Some of the benefits include:
- allowing users to start using the product at a low cost which reduces the barrier to entry
- charging customers proportionally to the value they
receive (making them more satisfied, which helps retention)
- expanding your TAM by making the product accessible for lower market customers
Value-based pricing has also been proven to drive higher ARPU (by over 20% per ProfitWell research).",Revenue,,,High,Yes
323,Competitors Comparison on Pricing Page,"Compare your prices to competing products. If your target market is price-sensitive people who do competitive research (and most do), this is how you wanna design your pricing page.",Revenue,,,Low,No
324,Pricing Add-Ons,Leverage add-ons (additional features paid extra) to increase ARPU. You should consider stripping your plans out of a feature and turning it into an add-on when it's used by less than 20% of your paying users.,Revenue,,,High,Yes
325,Life of Current Price,Create urgency by saying that the current price of a product lasts until X. People will feel the need to make a decision faster.,Revenue,,,Low,No
326,Pricing Page Copy Headline Fix,"Don't waste the precious real estate on your pricing page on vague headlines like 'Simple and transparent pricing' or 'Pricing that grows with your needs'. Instead, use it to reiterate the benefits your users are going to get if they decide to try your product.",Revenue,,,Low,No
327,Rule of 100,Give percentage discounts on prices below $100 and absolute discounts above that value. If you're using site-wide discounting use the $100 threshold for average order value at your store. This will increase their perceived size and make users feel like they're getting an even better deal.,Revenue,,,Low,No
328,ROI Calculator,"If you can clearly show how much tangible results your product can bring your customers, a good way to demonstrate it is by using a calculator. This will give you a powerful lever in convincing them that the pricing you offer is right and your product can generate a positive ROI for them.
Good examples: exitintelligence.com/pricing-roi & https://brightback.com/roi-calculator",Revenue,,,Moderate,Yes
329,Offer a Guarantee,"If you have a really solid product with very low return and complaint rates you should consider offering a guarantee.
Guarantees are effective when:
- users want what the company is promising
- users are nervous about the risk associated with buying the product or skeptical about your claims
- your service does live up to the claims you make
The best guarantees are worded positively. E.g. instead of saying “If you dislike our service…” say, “We guarantee that youʼll love our service.”",Revenue,,,Low,No
330,Expensive First,"In your pricing tables, sort plans from the most expensive to the least expensive. This should result in an increase in more revenue generated. Why?
There are actually 2 possible cognitive biases that have an effect here:
1. Anchoring - when users evaluate a list of products, they use the initial prices they see to generate their reference price. Lower price seems like a better deal
-> more people buy.
2. Loss Aversion - after seeing the plan with the best features first, others seem to be less valuable and users prefer higher plans -> higher ARPU.",Revenue,,,Low,No
331,Outcome Value Metrics over Feature Differentiation,"Differentiate your pricing plans based on a value metric instead of features. As Patrick Campbell of ProfitWell says: price is the exchange rate for the value you're creating with your product. Thus, it should be increasing with the increasing value of your product to your users.
Outcome value metrics (e.g. how much money you made your customer, how many views your video got etc.) are highly correlated with lower churn - ProfitWell research indicates it's almost 3x lower than when using feature differentiation (screenshot).
Also, when comparing companies who use a value metric to those who donʼt, youʼll note that those utilizing value metrics are growing at nearly double the rate as those deploying strictly feature differentiation (ProfitWell data).",Revenue,,,High,Yes
332,Upgrade or Data Deleted,Incentivize users whose trial ended to purchase a paid plan by informing them that their app data will get deleted if they don't upgrade their account. You can offer them a discount as an extra push.,Revenue,,,Low,No
333,The 'Ugly Brother' Effect,"Add a slightly ""uglier"" (less valuable, less beautiful) version of your main product/service for the same price. Users will view the base product as more attractive and will be more willing to choose it.",Revenue,,,Low,No
334,Pricing - Decoy Effect,"Made famous by The Economist magazine's pricing page (they still use it, so it's been probably working well for them), decoy effect is a cognitive bias where people change their preferences regarding two options when a third, asymmetrically dominated, is introduced.
I.e. when there are only two options - people make a choice based on their personal preferences. But when offered a third option (priced a little lower than the most expensive one and/or with much worse features), they are more likely to choose the more expensive of the two original options.",Revenue,,,Low,No
335,Price Partitioning,"Price partitioning means the division of a productʼs price into several components, provided that the components cannot be bought separately. Create an impression that the base product itself is priced reasonably but add-ons or upgrades can be bought additionally.",Revenue,,,Low,No
336,Pricing Localization,"ProfitWell, in an analysis of 457 SaaS companies, found that those with a greater focus on localization were growing faster. Starting from simple changes like converting prices to local currency, you should make sure your pricing is adjusted to the main regions you do business in.
Two types of localization:
1. cosmetic localization - converting price to local currency, translating your website to more languages
2. true market localization - pricing based on market saturation and willingness to pay
Remember - different regions have different willingness to pay, so your pricing approach should mirror that.",Revenue,,,Moderate,Yes
337,Upgrade Prompt Before Plan Limit,"Prompt users getting close to their plan resources limits to upgrade to a higher plan. Don't let the limits stop them from using your product when they'll need it (e.g. a user might want to create a new campaign on a short notice using your tool but learns there are no credits left - she then has to wait for her supervisor to upgrade the account and the campaign doesn't go out on time).
Use positive wording for the message e.g. ""Great job! You've sent 4995 emails this month. There's only 5 left in your plan. Reach even more people by upgrading your account.""",Revenue,,,Moderate,Yes
338,Contact a Coworker,"Reach out to people who are decision-makers (or just other people at relevant positions) at companies that signed up for your trial but didn't purchase a premium plan. The original person who signed up thought your product is right for their company's needs but for some reason didn't upgrade their account. There's a chance they weren't in the position to make the purchase, got busy, forgot about it, or some other reason. Contacting a different person might produce better results and since you can find their email/LinkedIn in no time, it's definitely worth trying.",Revenue,,,Low,No
339,Tunnel Checkout,Remove header and footer from checkout to create a distraction-free 'tunnel'. Reducing the number of options a user has will increase the chance they will perform the action you want them to take and proceed further in the checkout process.,Revenue,,,Low,Yes
340,Remove Coupon Fields from Checkout,Seeing a coupon code field makes people (without coupon codes) wonder why haven't they received a promo code and others have. A part of them will leave your site in search of a code and never come back again if they don't find one. A good solution is to have the coupon code field hidden under a link that opens it on click. Just make sure it's not too explicit.,Revenue,,,Low,Yes
341,Reframe Price into Daily Cost,"Show how much your product costs per day, next to the monthly price e.g. $30/month, that's just $1/day.",Revenue,,,Low,No
342,Move Account Creation After Purchase,Don't make users create accounts before checking out. Always allow for guest checkout. You can collect more information from them after the purchase.,Revenue,,,Moderate,Yes
343,Upsell' on Thank You Page,"This is a moment when users' motivation is high. They've also already developed a certain level of trust by converting for the first time. That's why they're more likely to take another action now. Or, refer a friend. Plus, you already have their contact info, so they don't have to input it again to convert once more. This tactic leverages what's called a 'yes ladder', or 'foot in the door' technique. Once someone says 'yes' once, they're more likely to say 'yes' once more.
Note: don't ever do this after users sign up for your app. Your goal then is to get them to see the value of your product asap and you shouldn't distract them.",Revenue,,,Low,Yes
344,Trust Seals at Checkout,"Trust seals make customers feel more comfortable handing over their sensitive information to you and increase your conversions. In general, the less known your brand is, the more of an impact they will have.
Go for the badges that you think your visitors will be
most familiar with.",Revenue,,,Low,Yes
345,Cause-Based Incentives,For each purchase we donate $10 to charity X'. Make sure to choose a charity that's close to your target audience's interest.,Revenue,,,Low,No
346,Don't Remove Absent Features From Pricing Plans,Use FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) to incentivize users to select more expensive plans. Show absent features in lower plans to make sure users know what they are missing out on by not choosing a higher plan.,Revenue,,,Low,No
347,Specific Numbers in Pricing Tables,Using specific numbers is more credible than using generic phrases. E.g. use '63% of users' instead of 'most popular' as most companies do.,Revenue,,,Low,No
348,Display Prices in Small Font Size,"Your prices will be perceived as smaller when they're displayed in small font and positioned next to larger elements. If you're using discounting, make the discounted price large to further enhance this effect.",Revenue,,,Low,No
349,Click to Tweet,"Add a click to tweet link in your blogposts to make it easy for users to share the best parts of your articles.
Tool: clicktotweet.com",Referral,,,Low,No
350,Referral Contest,"B2C: Incentivize users to engage and share your content by running a contest, where users are rewarded for each referral action with points.
Participants who gather the most points receive access to your product or get prizes related to your product. Make sure to give some small reward also to those users that participated but didn't get the main prizes. You can offer them a discount for your product.
Example tools: viral-loops.com, vyper.io",Referral,,,Moderate,Yes
351,Generate Referrals From Invoices,Encourage users to refer others by placing a referral link in your invoice email (and billing page in your product). The moment they see the invoice is likely to be the time they're most motivated to save thus will be also likely to take the action that you'll present them.,Referral,,,Moderate,Yes
352,Easter Egg Marketing,"Hide special features of your product and make them known initially only to a small group of users.
Example: Snapchat's black & white filter. Easter eggs
are powerful as they go against users' expectations. People love knowing secrets but they like to share them even more - other users who see them will start asking how you did it -> instant virality.",Referral,,,High,Yes
353,Invite Prompt During Onboarding,"If your product benefits from being used by more than one user, add a prompt to invite more team members after the initial signup, during onboarding. Explain how collaboration will bring more value to your users.",Referral,,,Moderate,Yes
354,Refer Friends to Unlock a Feature,Incentivize sharing of your app by letting users on free plan unlock some premium features by referring others.,Referral,,,High,Yes
355,Invite from Address Book,"Make the referral process a seamless experience for your users by letting them invite others from all their address books like Gmail, Outlook, and others. Not having them remember or type their friends'/colleagues' emails will greatly increase the number of invites sent per user.
Tool: cloudsponge.com",Referral,,,Moderate,Yes
356,Downgrade Trial to a Forever Free Plan,"After the trial ends, downgrade it to a forever free plan with very limited features. This way you're not losing users and still have a chance of converting them to a paid plan.",Retention,,,Moderate,Yes
357,Incentivized User Interview,"After the trial ends, offer users an interview about the experience of using your product in exchange for a discount on a paid plan or first month for free.",Retention,,,Low,No
358,Social Resurrection,"Bring back inactive users by leveraging other people in the users' network. When they join your product or reach an important milestone in it, let your inactive users know about it.
What this does is:
a) inactive users learn that their connections see value in your product (social proof)
b) inactive users are reminded to come back to your product by their connections and not you, which is more effective",Retention,,,High,Yes
359,Send Handwritten Cards to Customers,Celebrate accomplishments in app/milestones/anniversaries by sending handwritten cards to your customers. This will help you build a better relationship as few companies do this.,Retention,,,Moderate,No
360,Customize CTA Copy to Section Content,Don't use the same CTA copy throughout your pages. Make sure that they're relevant to the copy they follow.,Acquisition,,,Low,No
361,Crowdsource Feature Ideas,"Encourage your users to let you know which features they'd like to have in your product/what new courses they'd like to see etc. Make it easy for them by placing a voting widget inside your product. It's a win-win situation: your users get features they actually need and feel heard, and you get quality feedback on what to build next.
Example tool: nolt.io",Retention,,,Moderate,Yes
362,Exit Survey,"Gather crucial qualitative feedback from users who no longer want to use your product.
Ask them about the reason they're leaving, what (if any) tool they'll be switching to, what did they like about your product the most etc. Additionally, use conditional logic to get more detailed answers e.g. if the reason for churning was lack of features, ask them what features would make them stay. Make it as easy as possible to fill out to maximize the # of answers. It's important to include open-ended questions to get more insightful answers.
If you offer a free trial, try to get feedback from both trial users who didn't upgrade and paid users who churned. Ask for it both in-app and by email.",Retention,,,Moderate,No
363,Gamified Free Trial Extension,"Give users extra trial days for using more product features or performing social actions e.g. inviting friends/sharing your content. If they really need more time to evaluate your product, these actions will give them a chance to see the value of it and make them more likely to upgrade to a paid plan.",Retention,,,High,Yes
364,Community for Customers,"Keep your customers up to date with all the latest tips and best practices of using your product by creating a community (Slack, Facebook group etc.). They are like an in-app live chat but more powerful. Users can get to know each other, exchange knowledge and talk about how each of them uses your product. This results in leveling up your users' expertise in using your product, which makes them more likely to keep using it for longer.",Retention,,,High,No
365,Account Pause,Let users pause their accounts instead of canceling their subscription. They may have periods when they don't need your product but will want to use it again soon. This way they will be more likely to unpause and come back in the future than if they canceled and lost their data.,Retention,,,Moderate,Yes
366,Reactivation Loops,"Make active users continuously pull inactive users back to the product, reminding them of the core value. E.g. when you're endorsed on LinkedIn, you not only get an email but an app notification as well. More importantly, LinkedIn encourages you to keep the momentum going by endorsing other people in your network (who hopefully will do the same thing).",Retention,,,Moderate,Yes
367,Newsletter Segmented by Topic,Segment your newsletter subscribers and offer them content only on the specific topics that they're interested in. This will result in higher engagement with the content you send them.,Retention,,,Moderate,No
368,Downsell On Cancellation,Try offering a lower-priced package/product when users are about to churn or remove products from their cart. Chances are it's because of the price being too high for them.,Retention,,,Moderate,Yes
369,Use Signin Page to Show Product Updates,"Use the otherwise unused space of your sign-in page to notify your users about new product updates. This will help faster feature adoption, which will make users get more value from your product, which in turn will improve their retention.",Retention,,,Low,Yes
370,Happy Birthday' Reactivation Email,"Use this tactic as a final attempt to bring inactive users back. It relies on the same logic as Birthday Paradox - in a room of 23 people, there's a 50% chance that 2 of them have a birthday on the same day. If you apply this to your email list, there's a big chance that a part of them just had, or will soon have a birthday. To target an even larger group of people, say 'Happy (belated) Birthday' in the subject line.
Then just say that you're sorry you missed their birthday but have a special promo for them. It's hard to imagine someone reacting in a negative way to birthday wishes and a promo offer.",Retention,,,Low,No
371,Facebook Messenger Newsletters,"Send newsletter in Facebook Messenger and leverage open rates and CTRs a couple of times higher than when using email.
Tool: mailport.io","Activation ,Revenue, Retention",,,Low,No
372,Create a Calculator,"If your product or service saves money / allows to make more money in a predictable way, use a calculator that allows users to calculate their gains thanks to using your product or service. This makes it much easier to show a positive ROI of your offering. Of course, you can use a calculator to show gains in traffic, conversions etc. and not only money. Good example: https://exitintelligence.com/pricing- roi/
Tools (if you don't feel like coding it): https://www.involve.me/calculator/ https://outgrow.co/calculator/","Activation,Revenue",,,Moderate,Yes
373,Gamified Activation,"Utilize stuff like leaderboards, badges for completing tasks, and other rewards that encourage engagement with your product.","Activation,Referral",,,Moderate,Yes
374,Reactivation Email,"After a user has been inactive for a given amount of time, send them a reminder email encouraging to return to your product.
You can also offer them extra credits as an incentive.","Activation,Retention",,,Low,No
375,Personal Welcome from Founder,"Display a personal message from the founder to users after signing up for your product. Basecamp does this well with a welcome note from Jason Fried, saying that users can contact him anytime in case of questions and gives them his email and Twitter handle. This simple move adds a personal touch and makes users feel welcome.","Activation,Retention",,,Low,No
376,Search Box Inside Email,Increase email click rates by including a search box in email copy. Make sure that the landing page also has a search functionality.,"Activation,Retention",,,Low,No
377,Personalized App Dashboard,"Personalize app dashboard using user's company logo and colors. Make them feel like they own it. This creates an endowment effect - humans place a greater value on things once they have established ownership. This way they will be reluctant to part with your product.
Tool: https://www.brandfetch.io/personalization-api","Activation,Retention",,,Moderate,Yes
378,Summary Email,"Send a weekly/biweekly summary of users' activity/accomplishments in your app via email. If possible, let them know the positive effects your app made on their life/business e.g. 'last week our app helped you generate extra 57 leads'. Seeing tangible effects will make users want to stick to your product for a long time.","Activation,Retention",,,Moderate,Yes
379,Reactivation Email,Send an email after a period of inactivity encouraging users to go back to your product. You can incentivize them e.g. by giving them credits to use your product - they just need to return to the app to claim them.,"Activation,Retention",,,Moderate,No
380,Behavioral Emails,"Send automated emails based on user activity and behavior in the app. E.g. encourage to finish what they started, congratulate on reaching a milestone etc.","Activation,Retention",,,Moderate,Yes
381,Search Autocomplete,"Adding or improving (autocomplete) on a search box will increase the average search length by 1.6 words (from 1.7 to 3.3) (Nachoanalytics data). Having good auto-complete changes what gets searched, making the searches more specific and relevant. And by making the searches more specific, the quality of the search result becomes better, making people more likely to click on them. So as search length increases so does the conversion rate.
You can track the quality of your search results performance by measuring the CTR from your search results page.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
382,Offer a Trial Extension,"After a user ends their free trial period and doesn't decide to upgrade to a paid plan yet, offer to extend their trial. Some users may need more time to get value from your product than others, others may have just forgotten about it but still want to try it out. Also, make it easy for them to extend it on their own, with one click, after they return to app.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
383,Reactivate Old Trial Users,Create a custom audience of users who went  through a trial of your product but didn't upgrade. Show them ads announcing new features to encourage them to come back and give your product another shot. This audience should be more cost- effective to re-acquire than acquiring a cold user.,Activation,,,Moderate,No
384,Leverage Empty States,"Empty states are screens in your app that don't contain any information yet. When neglected, users may feel left alone and don't know the next steps they need to take to get value from your product.
They should be used to encourage users to interact with your app and show the specific actions you want them to take. E.g. add a call to action, add an arrow pointing to the UI element you want them to click, display tips etc.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
385,Extended Trial Drip,"Extend your trial drip beyond the trial duration. As a part of users will convert a couple of days after the trial ends, it's important to stay on top of their minds until they are ready to make the purchase.",Activation,,,Moderate,No
386,Free Premium Trial,"Offer a limited-time free trial of your premium plan to freemium users. This way you're showing them what they're missing out on by not upgrading their account.
They will be able to use the premium features of your product, (hopefully) experience the extra value, and once the trial ends, they'll be more likely to upgrade their subscription.
Why does this work?
Endowment effect - we don't like to lose things we own (even for a short period of time). We tend to become extremely attracted to objects in our possession, and feel anxious to give them up.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
387,Rewards for Using More Features,"Give app credits for using more app features. This incentivizes users to use your app more, which increases the chance of them seeing the value of your app. This, plus the free credits, makes them more likely to upgrade to a paid plan and keep using it. After they get the free credits, they will just feel the need to use them (and the premium app account) - it's like free money after all.",Activation,,,High,Yes
388,Personal Onboarding,"In the early stages of growing your product, doing the onboarding process personally is a great way to meet and talk to your users. They'll be getting premium training and become better at using your product, plus feel the exclusivity of the personal treatment, thus value your product more.
An example of this tactic performed almost faultlessly is Superhuman, who still onboard every single user personally, even though their user base is in thousands.
Although it's a high-touch and time-consuming process, you'll be able to get invaluable insights about your users and their experience with your product.",Activation,,,High,No
389,Checklist in Email,Include a checklist in your onboarding emails to specify which actions users should take first in order to fully take advantage of your product's capabilities. Mark the first step (signup) complete to make it work as a small win for the user. Need to complete is a psychological effect that makes humans motivated  to finish a set of tasks for the sole sake of getting the satisfaction of completing them. People just donʼt  like to leave things incomplete.,Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
390,Reiterate Product Benefits During Onboarding,"Remind users about the benefits your product will bring them in order to increase the activation rate. This will make them more likely to actively use it as they'll want to experience these benefits themselves.
E.g. the average amount of time your users save, average increase in CTR etc.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
391,Welcome to X from Founder + CC,"Send a welcome email addressed directly from the founder, where you introduce (and CC) your product and/or support person. Let users know that they can reach out to the most competent people at your team. Make them feel important.",Activation,,,Low,No
392,Sequential Retargeting,"Sequential retargeting is the practice of varying the ad offer depending on where the visitor is in the conversion process, with the end goal of pushing them along. The first ad is trying to get the sale as fast as possible. If that doesnʼt happen within a certain amount of time, then the sequential ads are pushed live one by one. Example: you're retargeting visitors to your product pages:
1st ad: drive to signup 2nd ad: case study #1 3rd ad: case study #2 4th ad: ebook",Activation,,,Moderate,No
393,Incentivized Onboarding Checklist,"Take your in-app onboarding checklist to a higher level by offering something in return for completing action items. Examples: app credits for watching a tutorial video, extra points for installing the app code snippet on their website. This should increase the number of events per user at the onboarding stage, creating more users who reach the aha moment.",Activation,,,High,Yes
394,Personalize Onboarding Based on User Type,"The more relevant experience you provide during onboarding, the more your users will be likely to see the value your product provides. To do this, add an additional field(s) to the signup form and customize the experience based on its input. E.g. Canva displays templates matching the needs of their specific personas.",Activation,,,High,Yes
395,Retargeting App Users,Use GDN/FB to push users to perform next actions in app.,Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
396,Onboarding Checklist,"Using a checklist in your in-app onboarding flow helps users go through the steps that you define as key to getting to the aha moment as quickly as possible.
How to make it seem easier to complete:
- cross out the already completed actions (completion bias)
- add the time each task takes to complete (if short)",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
397,Fake Supply,"When starting a two-sided platform, the easiest way to accelerate growth is to grow the supply i.e. 'seller' side first.
Take Tinder as an example - the “supply” of (attractive) women on their platform is what triggers the participation of men (""demand"").
To make this process quicker, you can try and create fake supply by creating e.g. fake profiles until your platform gets enough 'real' supply. Just make sure this isn't harmful to the experience of your product.",Activation,,,Moderate,No
398,Bulleted Reassurances,"Bullet points are a useful element as they allow to quickly display the most important points that you want to convey and use little space on the page. They work especially well near points of friction like CTA buttons.
Examples: benefits of your product; reassurances reducing friction such as: no CC required, cancel anytime, full access etc.","Acquisition, Revenue,     Referral",,,Low,No
399,Syndicated Reviews,B2C: Take reviews of the products you sell from manufacturers' websites and use them on your website before you get enough of your own ones.,"Acquisition, Revenue",,,Low,No
400,Comparison Table vs Competitors,People rarely buy software without doing some research. How can you make their choice easier (in your favor)? Create a table comparing your product to your main competitors. This allows you to clearly pinpoint where your product is superior and making the choice easy for visitors. Tip: put 1 or 2 aspects (of little importance) where your competitors are better - your comparison will seem less subjective. This tactic works well on pricing pages.,"Acquisition,Revenue",,,Low,Yes
401,Help Employees Convince Their Boss to Pay for Your Product,"Very often, users who evaluate your product have no purchasing power due to their position at their company. Help them convince their boss to buy your product by providing them with a ready-to-send email copy explaining the benefits that using your product will have on the company's results. That's the end result that they care about in the end.
Example: https://conversionxl.com/institute/reimbursement/","Acquisition, Revenue",,,Low,No
402,User Generated Content,Create authenticity and trust towards your brand by using content created by your customers and use it to attract new ones.,"Acquisition,Referral",,,Moderate,No
403,Influencer Referral Loop,Give influencers who invite other influencers to your product a share of all sales initiated by them.,"Acquisition,Referral",,,Moderate,No
404,Messenger Bot Giveaways,"Run a giveaway using Facebook Messenger for higher engagement. Users are enrolled in Manychat by commenting on a post -> can get more points in the contest by referring friends directly in Messenger.
Tool: viral-loops.com","Acquisition,Referral",,,Moderate,No
405,Referral Giveaway,"Run a giveaway where participants are awarded points for social actions such as sharing and liking your content, inviting others etc. The goal is to create a viral effect and make the participants spread the word about the competition for you.
Reward users who rank in the top x spots or reach a certain number of points.
Tools: viral-loops.com, vyper.io","Acquisition,Referral",,,Moderate,No
406,Host a Live Video,"Broadcast live some interesting part of doing your business - coding, designing, building campaigns, or do a video AMA. This is a great way to build an audience and a strong relationship with them. This makes them feel like they're a part of your journey.
Tools: Twitch/Facebook live","Acquisition, Retention",,,Moderate,No
407,Host an AMA,"Build a relationship with your audience and customers by hosting an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session. Answer all questions people may have about your product, business, yourself, your journey etc. It works well both for your existing users' retention, as well as for acquiring new ones.","Acquisition,Retention",,,Low,No
408,Direct/Personal Cold Email Subject Line,"Make your cold emails seem like they come from someone you know. E.g. 'hey {FNAME}, quick question' or 'I found you through CONTACT NAME'.","Acquisition,Retention",,,Low,No
409,Individualized Invitations,"Remove friction from signing up to webinars, downloading ebooks etc. by making them available simply by replying to an email. Another benefit to it is that you have a chance to build a rapport with your customers, answer any question they may have, and basically let them know that you're there for them if they need any help.","Acquisition,Retention",,,Low,No
410,Resend Emails to Non-openers with New Subject Lines,"48hrs or so after the first send, resend your email to non-openers with a changed subject line. There's no need to write a whole new email content if your email was not even opened.","Acquisition,Activation,Revenue
Retention     Referral",,,Low,No
411,Visual Cues,"Direct users' attention towards a desired point on the page e.g. a signup box, using visual cues such as:
- arrows
- people gazing
- pointing fingers
This makes sure visitors (subliminally) know what the most important elements on the page are, thus are more likely to interact with them.","Acquisition,Activation,Revenue
Retention     Referral",,,Low,No
412,P.S. in Emails,"Very often, P.S. is the first thing users read in your email. It's a good opportunity to reiterate your CTA or offer something extra.","Acquisition ,Activation ,Revenue
Retention     Referral",,,Low,No
413,Done For You' Premium Service,"Offering services alongside your product is a great ""things that don't scale"" strategy to improve the adoption of your product that will help you convert more customers.
As Redpoint Ventures' Tomasz Tunguz says: “At the beginning of a new wave, most customers donʼt understand the technology well. So, they seek experts to guide them. Companies that provide services and education often win the early market. They develop customer relationships, reinforce their expertise with a strong brand, define the purchasing criteria in their favor and ultimately grow faster.”
While his advice is specific to products built in early markets, this strategy can be easily applied to early- stage products looking to gain traction even in established markets.
Some real-life examples:
- if your product is an app builder → offer custom app development services
- web scraping product → create custom scrapers for your users
- text analysis software → create custom models for your users","Acquisition,Activation, Revenue, Retention",,,High,Yes
414,"Call to Value, not Call to Action","As Joanna Wiebe from Copyhackers says: ""A call to value is best for people before theyʼve decided to buy; it reinforces the value of the offering and works toward convincing the prospect.
A call to action is best for people once theyʼve decided to buy; they already understand the value, so itʼs time to stop selling and just make it as frictionless as possible for them to give you their email addy or credit card deets.""","Acquisition, Activation ,    Referral ,Retention

415,Warm Up Email Account,"Every new domain comes with a neutral reputation. It takes time to earn a good or bad reputation.
Domains with bad reputations can be hit with penalties that impact deliverability, which is a huge business risk.
You can improve your new email address' deliverability by 'warming it up'. If you don't do it and start sending emails at scale right away, there's a very high risk of them landing all in spam.
Warming up an email involves a gradual increase in your email sending volume day by day (and ideally getting your emails opened and replied to). You can do this process manually, which involves quite some manual work. But it's better to automate it using a tool like Lemlist that sends and get replies to emails to warm up your email account.

Revenue",,,Low,No
416,What Users Created Using Your Product,Show what your users created using your product to help others easier envision what's possible. An extra benefit is that the user whose work was showcased will feel special for being recognized and given exposure. This can be done on a weekly/monthly basis depending on the number of users actively using your product.,"Acquisition, Activation ,Retention",,,Moderate,No
417,Flip the Funnel,"Allow users to experience the product before making them sign up. This way you can get more users to reach the activation point. After they've experienced the value of your product, you'll have an easier job of making them sign up e.g. after a user converts a file and before downloading it.
When does it make sense to test this tactic? When the time it takes to get value is very short and you don't risk that a lot of users will abandon your product before getting value.","Acquisition, Activation",,,High,Yes
418,Announce New Features in Widgets,"Notify visitors about new, important features in your product using widgets. This will make sure they get noticed.","Acquisition,Activation",,,Moderate,Yes
419,Product VIdeos,"- Viewers are anywhere from 64-85% more likely to buy after watching a product video.
- Over 60% of consumers watch product review videos before making a purchase.
- Product videos help explain products better and answer users' questions.
- Video viewers also stay longer on site.
You just can't go wrong with product videos. So if you can afford them, use them.",Acquisition,,,High,No
420,Competitor Comparison Pages,"Competitor comparison pages are a great type of content to capture high-intent traffic that is already in the decision-making phase. This is a perfect moment to grab their attention and showcase how your product is superior to competitors. Once you create one such page, you can reuse the page template and easily scale it and produce content comparing your product to other competitors. How to make the most of it:
- focus on competitors' biggest weaknesses (read through review sites to find them)
- if possible, use your positive customer reviews mentioning how users like an aspect where your competitor is lacking
- create a comparison table highlighting where your product is better
- use live chat to be able to answer any uncertainties
visitors may have
And if there is still not enough search traffic for phrases comparing you to your competitors, you can start by creating content comparing two of your competitors and including your product as the third alternative (tactic #291).",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
421,Negative Opt-Out in Popups,"⚠  Approach with caution! ⚠  Most popups have a CTA (or a signup box) and an 'X' to close the popup. Adding a 'no' option will increase the number of users who choose the 'positive' option e.g. 'no, I already have a lot of money' / 'no, my website already gets a ton of traffic'. People will not want to be the ones in the negative scenario and won't be prone to clicking this button. Be super cautious with this tactic as taking this too far will make users feel bad about themselves!",Acquisition,,,Low,No
422,Get Leads From Google Sheets/Docs/Slides,⚠  Gray/Black hat tactic ⚠  Post a link to a Google document without making it public -> people will send you an access request -> you'll get an email from Google with their name & email -> just give them the access with a message saying that you forgot to make the document public.,Acquisition,,,Low,No
423,Priming Step,"Add an extra step to the beginning of the signup flow explaining why users have to fill it out and what they'll receive in return. Even though it's an extra step, it doesn't add friction to the process. It reassures users and makes them comfortable in proceeding further.",Acquisition,,,Low,Yes
424,Convert Content Into Other Formats,"After a blogpost you wrote starts to perform well, turn it into other formats e.g. video, podcast etc. You already did the hardest work and came up with the content so why not scale it and distribute it on other platforms in new formats.",Acquisition,,,High,No
425,Contest Consolation Prize,"After taking part in a contest and not winning, offer a discount to all participants as a thank you.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
426,Customize Website For New Visitors / Customers,"Align website content to visitor type. E.g. why would you be offering your existing customers to sign up to your newsletter if they're already on your list?
Change this to e.g. a referral prompt.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
427,Add/Edit Quora Answer Wiki,"Answer wiki is a user-editable summary of all the answers to the question. Its goal is to provide a quick, generally-accepted answer solution rather than reading several lengthy answers. They work best when there are lots of:
different suggestions about the best products, movies, people etc.
lengthy answers all saying the same thing in a different form
Anyone can create an answer wiki but if it's done not objectively or in a clearly promotional way, it will surely be reported and subject to moderation.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
428,Anticipate Inner Dialogue,Anticipate what users will think when looking at your UI elements or reading your copy and provide the answers to their questions beforehand. Don't let any doubts arise in their heads that might kill your conversions.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
429,LinkedIn Ad Copy - Targeting Match,"As LinkedIn allows for very precise targeting in their ads, you can match the copy specifically to the audience you're targeting e.g. target CEOs at medical companies and lead the copy with ""CEO at a medical company?"" -> super high relevancy = higher CTRs.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
430,Reach Older Audiences on Logout Screens,"As older people tend to use email services like AOL, Yahoo, MSN etc. and log out after each session, you can reach them there by buying a banner ad placement. If you can afford such placement, you'll get cheap CPM and high CTR.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
431,Ask Your Users For Content Ideas,Ask your customers what topics are of particular interest to them. They will be happy to give you some ideas that will be surely also relevant to other people like them. This will help you not only satify your existing users but also attract new ones by creating relevant content.,Acquisition,,,Low,No
432,Twitter Bot,"Automate the process of replying to tweets with specific keywords by using a bot. If someone mentions a phrase that's relevant to your business, always have your helpful comment in there.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
433,Birthday Ads,"B2C: Target your ads to people with birthday/friends of people with birthday soon. Surprise them with a celebratory copy, image and a special offer just for them. This is an evergreen campaign - the audience is dynamic, meaning - you won't have any ad frequency issues. This tactic is proven to work especially well for brick and mortar businesses.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
434,Bid on Competitors' Phrases,Bidding on your competitors' brand keywords suggesting users are experiencing issues with their product (e.g. [competitor's name] + help/support/contact etc.) is a great way to get in front of an audience that may be happy to consider other products. Drive the traffic to a landing page comparing your competitor's product against yours and explaining why it's worth making a switch.,Acquisition,,,Low,No
435,Personalize Google Ads Copy Based on Location,"Boost your CTRs by ad copy personalized to searcher's location.
Instructions: https://metrictheory.com/blog/localize- your-ppc-improve-ctr-with-geo-ad-customizers/",Acquisition,,,Low,No
436,Personalize Landing Page Content,"Boost your landing page conversion rates by personalizing its content to users' location. What to personalize: images, copy including the location to make the LP as relevant as possible.
Instructions: http://blog.embertribe.com/how-to- personalize-your-landing-pages-dynamically -based- on-location",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
437,Rank on Your Competitors' Keywords,"Capture very high intent traffic by creating content ranking on your competitors' brand keywords. Users landing on it will usually be at the decision stage and convert well. Example content types:
- you vs your competitor
- comparison of your competitors
- pros and cons of your competitors
- competitors pricing
- competitors reviews
Great article on how to maximize your LPs performance https://www.poweredbysearch.com/blog/competitor- comparison-landing-pages-for-saas/",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
438,Engineering as Marketing,"Coined by Justin Mares (author of Traction), this tactic involves building tools useful to your target audience to funnel them later to use your product. If people found value in your side project, they will be more likely to try your main product. These may be in the form of calculators, microsites, tools, widgets.
Examples:
unbounce.com/landing-page-analyzer website.grader.com
buildfire.com/how-much-to-make-a-mobile-app- calculator
tools.pingdom.com
Side benefits of using this tactic are SEO - easy to get backlinks to such projects, and durability - they're relevant for long periods of time.",Acquisition,,,High,Yes
439,DSA + RLSA,Combine DSA (Dynamic Search Ads) and RLSA (Retargeting Lists for Search Ads) in one Google Search campaign to broaden the reach while keeping it relatively low risk as you're targeting your past website visitors only.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
440,Content Pruning,"Content pruning means removing low-quality content from your website to make your overall SEO performance rise. Why does this work? In short, domain authority is distributed to all your website content. If you remove the low-quality pages, your other ones will get more of the authority and rank higher. Weak content just waters down your website. Follow the attached Hubspot's decision tree for your poorly performing content.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
441,Text to App Install Form,"Convert desktop traffic to mobile app downloads using a text-to-download form on your page.
This allows visitors to receive a link to your app in a text message, so they can download it whenever itʼs convenient for them. This tactic greatly reduces the friction of installing your mobile app by desktop users.
Tool: linktexting.com or build it yourself using e.g. Zapier and Twilio",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
442,Create a Course,"Create a comprehensive course on a topic related to your business and end it with a certificate awarded for completing an exam.
Make it a go-to destination for people interested in a given topic and establish yourself as an expert in this field. An additional benefit is that after your course becomes a trusted source of information, people will be proud to share their certificates of completion on social media, which will bring new people to the course.",Acquisition,,,High,No
443,Ads Customized to CRM Deal Stage,Create a dynamic custom audience based on the CRM deal stage. Create a separate campaign for users at each stage and align the offer accordingly.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
444,Organic Facebook Lead Forms,Create a lead form and pin it to the top of your Facebook page to capture leads easily. How to do it: create a lead ad (without publishing it) -> go to posts tab in ads manager -> publish the post organically -> pin it to top,Acquisition,,,Low,No
445,Quora Ads - Blended-In Question,Create a Quora ad with a question headline that blends in with organic questions. This tactic counteracts banner blindness (users' tendency to ignore page elements they perceive to be ads).,Acquisition,,,Low,No
446,Popup Customized to Page Content,Create a separate exit-intent popup offer for each category of your blogposts for highest conversion rates. How CXL does this: CRO topic -> CRO quiz; analytics topic -> GA quiz.,Acquisition,,,Low,No
447,“Four Walls” Copy Technique,"Create an ad that poses four questions to your prospect, with each answer leading logically to the next, until, at the end of your ad, your prospect is all but committed to making the purchase. Not to scare buyers away, but to box them in, cause them to take a stand, and make a request that would demonstrate their commitment to their stand.
E.g. 'Do you enjoy spending hours scouring the web for potential clients? Don't you wish there was a better solution to this? A tool where you'd simply select the criteria and you'd get hundreds of quality contacts in a matter of seconds? How much would your business grow if you had such a tool? Introducing tool X...'
This is a perfect example of commitment & consistency bias at play - if you take a stand on an issue, you must remain consistent with your beliefs.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
448,Ask Questions for You to Answer on Quora,"Create questions on topics relevant to your business (from different accounts) and answer them, linking to your website. Use all relevant categories and invite all 25 people to answer your question to reach as many people as possible.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
449,Inline Validation,"Deliver messages to the user in real-time based on whether the information they entered in a form is correct or incorrect, instead of accumulating all errors and displaying them only after a user clicks the submit button. This greatly improves the user experience. Make sure you don't display an error message before a user has finished typing though - it can be both confusing and annoying.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
450,Form Field Focus,Direct users' attention to the first form field by automatically setting the focus to it. Enhance this effect by fading out the background around the form. Users will have no doubt about what action they should take next.,Acquisition,,,Low,Yes
451,Contact People Who Expressed a Need For a Product Like Yours,"DM/email people who expressed a need for a product like yours anywhere on the Internet. Google phrases suggesting someone might have the problem your product/service solves. Forums, Twitter, Quora, Reddit are good places to search.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
452,Match SSO to Traffic Source,"Driving traffic to your landing page from Facebook -> offer to sign up with Facebook single sign-on.
Driving traffic from Twitter -> offer to sign up with Twitter. If they're coming from a given platform, they'll be more willing to use SSO, which reduces friction from the signup process. Single sign-on is especially helpful for mobile users.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
453,Collect Leads Directly On Medium,Embed a Paperform/upscri.be form in a Medium post and capture readers' contact info like on your own website.,Acquisition,,,Low,No
454,Reciprocity,Example: ask for a favor (like taking a survey) in exchange for a promo code for your product.,Acquisition,,,Low,No
455,Segment Facebook Ad Sets by Country Tiers,"Facebook optimizes delivery to bring results at the lowest price possible. Having too many countries in one ad set will usually result in spending most of  your budget in the cheapest countries (where cheapest conversions happen). This way, the more expensive countries in your ad sets won't get enough impressions.
E.g. country tiers:
1. US, CA, AU, UK
2. DE, NL, FR
3. CZ, RU, UA",Acquisition,,,Low,No
456,Get on Top X Lists,"Find a relevant, high ranking top x list post and pay the author to get you on the list. Traffic from such pages is usually high intent so if the page is getting a decent amount of pageviews, your investment will quickly pay off.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
457,Link Intersect,"Find backlink opportunities using the Ahrefs Link Intersect tool. It shows all websites linking to your competitors but not to you. And if they link to let's say 3 or 4 of them, there's a large chance they'll be open to linking to your website as well.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
458,BuiltWith to Find Leads,"Find companies likely to be your target audience using BuiltWith. Lookup a technology and get all companies that have it implemented on their websites. Example: your product is an alternative to Hotjar - search BuiltWith for Hotjar and download a list of all companies using it (including their estimated tech spend and traffic) -> use this info for cold outreach campaigns using LinkedIn / find emails of relevant people using tools like hunter.io etc.
Example 2: you're a Shopify app developer - search BuiltWith for Shopify and get a list of all ecommerce stores set up on Shopify.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
459,Find Best Questions to Answer on Quora,"Find Quora questions that are ranking high in Google:
1. You need SEMrush for this (you can get 15 days free trial).
2. Go to ""Organic Search"" - ""Positions"".
3. Input quora.com into the search field.
4. Scroll down to ""Organic search positions"" and add 3 filters:
4.1. Include + Keyword + Containing + YOUR_KEYWORD
4.2. Include + Pos. + Less than + 10
4.3. Include + Volume + Greater than + 100
5. Hit ""Apply"".
6. Scroll down to the keywords.
7. There youʼll find a list of keywords where Quora is ranked on page #1 of Google.
8. Open each URL and add a valuable answer with a link to your website.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
460,Sticky CTA Bar on Mobile,Fix the CTA button to the bottom of mobile screens to have it handy for visitors so that they don't have to scroll back to the top/bottom of the page. Making it visible at all times will increase the chance of them clicking it and proceeding to the next step in the funnel.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
461,Add Current Year to Blogpost Title,Get higher CTR from the search results page by making your blogpost title look more relevant and up to date e.g. 'How much does it cost to organize a conference in 2020?' or 'Google Ads benchmarks [updated for 2020]',Acquisition,,,Low,No
462,YouTube Competitor Brand Name Pre-Roll Ads,Get in front of a targeted audience of your competitors' existing and potential clients using YouTube pre-roll ads. This high-quality audience can be reached at a fraction of a search ad CPC. Focus on making the first 5 seconds of your video engaging enough to avoid your ad being skipped.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
463,GIPHY Branded GIFs,"Get more exposure by creating your own branded GIFs.
How to do this:
1) Create a GIF relevant to what your target audience searches for. Include your product/logo/website
2) Upload to Giphy with relevant hashtags
3) Create 5 GIFs and apply for a free channel (this step allows for your GIFs to be publicly searchable)",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
464,Move Subdomains to Subdirectories,"Get more SEO juice from Google by moving your blog from subdirectory to subdomain i.e. blog.website.com -> website.com/blog
Moz found that by structuring your site with subdomains, you may confuse search engines. Also, you will separate a large portion of keywords under the subdomain and dilute backlink strength.
When does using subdomains make sense? When each subdomain functions as a separate entity within the overall corporation. Disney, for example, has cars.disney.com, videos.disney.com, disneyparks.disney.com, princess.disney.com, and each one serves a very different purpose. Backlinks to each of them won't dilute the topical focus of the site.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
465,Dynamic Keyword Insertion on Landing Page,"How the landing page copy matches your ad copy affects your conversion rates. Why? Your ad message sets the expectations that make users click your ad, so if your landing page offer is different than that in the ad, you may lose their trust. That's why dynamic keyword insertion comes handy for your Google Ads campaigns. You can use Google Optimize (or Unbounce's built-in feature) to insert the keyword that triggered your ad into your landing page copy and make it more relevant to visitors.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
466,Overcoming Ad Blockers for Facebook Ads,"If ad blockers are popular among your target audience (e.g, over 75% millennial gamers use them, while very few mobile users do), you should consider using the static image Facebook pixel instead of the JavaScript one. Ad blockers don't appear to block them.
Here's how to implement this (although it has its limitations): https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook- pixel/advanced#installing-the-pixel-using-an-img- tag",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
467,Don't Make Users Create Usernames,"If not absolutely necessary, don't make users create usernames. Email is enough of an identifier.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
468,Brand Defense Content,"If there are other companies trying to rank on [your company alternatives] phrase, create a page where you compare your product to your competitors.
Don't let others steal your brand traffic.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
469,Retargeting LP with Different Messaging,"If you're driving traffic to a custom landing page and users don't convert, you most likely didn't succeed in convincing them with your offer. It makes little sense retargeting them back to the exact same page. Use a landing page with a different value proposition (or a whole new way of explaining your product) to learn if it works better.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
470,Customize Landing Page Based on Referral Source,"If you're getting a significant amount of traffic to one of your pages from a given referrer, it makes a lot of sense to treat it like a landing page for paid campaigns - customize it to the traffic source for highest relevance. E.g. traffic coming from Noah Kagan's post -> use Noah Kagan's image and custom copy. Or, a more advanced example: add a section to the referral landing page that pulls stats from the referrerʼs usage of the product: “John, uses product_name X times per week to do Y. Heʼs saved Z hours/dollars using it.” (get an engineer to have the landing page automatically pull this non-sensitive data from the inviterʼs account.)",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
471,App Install Ads - Only on Wi-Fi,"If your app is over 100MB in size, you can significantly decrease your CPI (cost per install) by targeting only users on Wi-Fi. Those on cellular connection won't be able to install your app anyway as Apple doesn't allow for that anyway. Also, make sure to target only users with the OS versions supporting your app.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
472,Powered By,"If your product is embeddable on other websites (e.g. live chat, search bar, popup, form etc.), have it link back to your site on free plans, inviting people using it to try it out. If your product is not embeddable, make users' websites display your company's widget like e.g. Heap and Mixpanel do it. All these users' active pages will be linking back to your site with a dofollow backlink.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
473,Pre-Qualify Leads at Signup,"If your product/service is not targeted at low budget/low traffic customers, it makes sense to increase friction at signup and add questions that will weed them out. E.g. add a website traffic field to your form with an entry point set at a level you believe your leads must have to have a chance to become customers. Lower conversion rate will mean less unqualified leads, thus less wasted time for your sales team.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
474,Monopolize Search Ads,"If your products are available on other sites, consider sending visitors to them beyond your own site (3 top ads in the screenshots are Casper's too).",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
475,Star Ratings in SERP & Google Ads,Improve CTRs from Google search results and ads by implementing star ratings. Reviews = credibility.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
476,Before & After Campaigns,"In a study of 70 campaigns with transparent sales results, Gallup didn't find a single before & after campaign that didnʼt increase sales. They work so well because they use 2 main drivers to persuade people:
1. Pain (people's current state)
2. Desired outcome (where they want to be)
Note that Facebook doesn't allow to use before & after images to promote diet, weight loss, or other health-related products. You are free to use them for all other topics though. E.g. 'Before using tool X, company Y spent 12 hours a week on finding relevant contact info. Now, the whole process is streamlined thanks to tool X and takes just an hour a week. If that employee's time is worth $50/hour that's $550 savings a week and $2200 a month!'",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
477,Quiz in Exit Intent Popup,"Increase engagement with your exit-intent pop by using a quiz. Ask a couple of questions, then ask for an email to send the result. The highest converting quiz popups are relevant to page content e.g. CXL on blogposts about analytics had a quiz testing visitors their Google Analytics knowledge; on posts about CRO - a CRO knowledge quiz.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
478,Content Upgrades,"Increase the conversion rate from blog readers by offering content upgrades such as ebooks, checklists, cheat sheets, swipe files etc. Display them inside blog content and make sure they're highly relevant to the given blogpost and add extra value to it (e.g. offer extra stuff that was not included in the article).",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
479,Signup in a Lightbox,"Instead of having a user load a new signup page, load the signup screen in a lightbox. E.g. mixpanel.com does this.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
480,Single Sign-on,Integrate single sign-on to make it more convenient for users to log in or sign up for your product.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
481,Free Lead Enrichment and Scoring,"Lead scoring with Zapier and MadKudu allows to enrich up to 500 leads a month for free. Get company information such as size, industry, and location, and other. https://zapier.com/help/create/other- functions/score-leads-in-zaps
Requires Zapier premium plan or at least a free 7-day trial.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
482,Signup Lightbox Over App View,Let users see what they'll get and how close they are to getting it after they sign up. This should arouse their curiosity and increase motivation to complete the signup process.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
483,Self-Qualification Quiz,Let visitors answer a couple of questions (in a quiz form) about them or their needs and offer your product/service only if they meet the criteria. This way they develop trust towards you as you're not trying to sell them your product at all costs but offer a solution to their actual needs.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
484,See How It Looks on Your Website',"Let visitors see how your product would look like on their website. Let them enter their website URL and generate a preview. This not only allows your visitors to easier understand how your product works but also, the endowment effect occurs - people place a greater value on things once they have established ownership. Thus, they are more likely to want to give your product a shot by starting a trial or purchasing a plan. If they don't, you have their website URL and can find their email address this way (just use hunter.io or similar tool).",Acquisition,,,High,Yes
485,Pin a DM CTA Tweet,"Make it easy for Twitter users to message you by pinning a direct message CTA tweet to the top of your profile. First, make sure to have the option 'Accept DMʼs from anyone' switched on. Then:
1. Find your numeric Twitter account ID here:
tweeterid.com
2. Add this link to the end of your tweet: https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=
{ insert-ID-from step-1-
here}&text=your%20CTA%20copy
3. Pin your tweet",Acquisition,,,Low,No
486,Concierge Migration,"Offer to migrate the data of users switching to your product from competitors to let them get up to speed quickly, which will improve their retention.
While as much of this process should be automated (see Tactic #292: Data Import in Onboarding), it's not always doable. So it makes sense to offer a manual 'concierge migration' service if the expected LTV of users you provide this service for will be high enough to make it profitable
Example: ConvertKit offers free migrations for users on any paid plan: https://convertkit.com/migrations. They also have 2 migration options depending on how big the users' email list is (which is tied to their expected LTV) - users with larger lists get a more comprehensive service.",Acquisition,,,High,Yes
487,Acquisition Loops,Make your product your acquisition tool. Invite new users to sign up for your product after they have just successfully interacted with it. E.g. Typeform inviting users to create their own survey after completing one they got from someone else.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
488,Automatic Just-In-Time Webinar,Maximize the percentage of signups who actually attend your webinar by letting users watch it almost instantly. The pre-recorded webinar is available on request and users can select a time that is convenient for them (starts in a couple of minutes). It's also a perfect lead generation tactic to use in exit-intent popups. Tool: https://livestorm.co/,Acquisition,,,High,No
489,Merge Two Pieces of Content,"Merge two (or more) average-performing pieces of content into one to get more organic traffic. Why does this work? The page authority of merged pages is combined into one. And, the resulting article is more comprehensive as it contains information from multiple articles. Make sure to use a 301 redirect to the 'stronger' article (higher page authority).",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
490,Newsjacking,"Newsjacking is the art and science of injecting your ideas into a breaking news story so you and your ideas get noticed. If something's just been made popular, there will be lots of people searching for that topic. Product content on that topic to get it in front of these people, plus generate backlinks to your site.",Acquisition,,,High,No
491,Decrease Page Loadtime,Obvious but very often forgotten. This tactic is hugely effective and always works. Higher conversion rates. Better SEO. Better UX.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
492,Boost Your Article to the Top of Any Major Publication,"Online publications such as Forbes, Inc. etc. put their most popular content on top of their homepage making it seen by even more visitors. How to get there if you succeed in having your article published by one of these publishers?
Step 1 - create a Twitter post with a link to your article. We want to drive traffic to our article through a link from an organic source so that the publication doesn't suspect anything.
Step 2 - this one's crucial - grab the t.co link that
Twitter automatically shortens your proper link to Step 3 - run ads driving cheap traffic to your article via the shortened link. How to get the cheapest link clicks e.g. from Facebook? Target the whole Facebook network without any narrowing and optimize for link clicks (of course) - Facebook will get you the cheapest clicks possible.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
493,Don't Make Forms Look Like Forms,"People don't like filling out forms. Make them look like they're not forms whenever possible. Use large, clickable images and toggle sliders to make filling them out more fun for users.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
494,Upfront Progress,"People feel a higher need to complete a task as it gets closer to completion. That's why some coffee shops give away pre-stamped cards with two stamps instead of one. On the Internet, show the progress users have already made as e.g. a crossed-out item on the onboarding checklist, 50% complete bar on the popup after only having clicked it etc. Just make sure that users feel the progress as soon as possible.",Acquisition,,,Low,Yes
495,Social Proof Next to Friction Point,"Placing a social proof element next to a point of friction decreases psychological resistance that your visitors experience when trying to complete an action. E.g. forms, CTA buttons etc.
Examples of social proof:
- customer logos
- number of users
- testimonial
- awards/certifications
- press mentions
- ratings from App Stores / user review sites like Capterra",Acquisition,,,Low,Yes
496,Prominent Contact Information,Put your company phone number (and email) at the top of the page so visitors know they can easily reach you if they need any help. It also makes you more trustworthy as you don't seem like you try to avoid contact with visitors.,Acquisition,,,Low,Yes
497,Contact Unhappy Competitors' Users,"Reach out to unhappy users that leave negative feedback about competing products on review sites like G2, Capterra etc. They'll be more than happy to hear about a better solution to their need that wasn't satisfied by the competing product. You can even go a step further and monitor the review sites for new, negative reviews using a tool like visualping.io",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
498,Breadcrumb Technique,"Removing as many form fields as possible leaves users with just the most intimidating ones to fill - personal info. So the goal of the breadcrumb technique is to get the visitor to micro-convert before asking for contact info. How? By asking questions that are easy to answer and let them stay anonymous. E.g. a growth agency may ask prospects about the funnel step that is of highest priority for them at the moment; a software dev shop may ask what is the scope of the project - mobile/web/both (these answers don't even have to be useful to you). Note: this tactic only works for big asks, e.g. quotes (not stuff like ebook downloads). For best results  use dropdowns or radio buttons to make it as easy  as possible to answer.",Acquisition,,,Low,Yes
499,Re-post Website Content on Medium,Republish your content on Medium for extra exposure to a new audience. There won't be any duplicate content issues as you will get a canonical link from Medium. More info on that here: https://help.medium.com/hc/en- us/articles/217991468-SEO-and-duplicate-content,Acquisition,,,Low,No
500,Turn a Blogpost Into an Ebook,Repurpose some of your best-performing blog content into ebooks. Merge blogposts on similar topics to create comprehensive guides. Further expand and update the already detailed articles. Use the ebooks for lead gen or as content upgrades.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
501,Cross-Promotion,Run a cross-promotion campaign with a company with a similar audience as yours but not directly competing with you. Seasonal discounts and referral contests tend to work well.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
502,Scrape Emails from Slack Groups,Scrape relevant Slack groups and extract emails of their members (not all groups display their members' emails) using Phantombuster https://phantombuster.com/phantombuster/12190/sla ck-channel-user-extractor,Acquisition,,,Low,No
503,Cold Email Invitation,Send a cold email pretending to be an invitation to a community/social network site. Aroused curiosity will make people prone to click and check your product.,Acquisition,,,Low,No
504,Sequential Campaigns,"Show a series of ads to a particular user, in a specific order, for a specific number of days. If a user converts, he's excluded from the rest of the sequence. Use each ad to show a different feature/use case/USP of your product. E.g. user visited a landing page but didn't sign up for a free trial. Set up a Facebook campaign consisting of 4  ads that will be shown one after another, for 3 days each. Each ad will need a custom audience made up with LP visitors from last x days e.g. 1st ad: last 3 days, 2nd ad: last 6 days with last 3 days excluded, 3rd ad: last 9 days with last 6 days excluded, and so on.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
505,Progress Bar on Signup,Show users how close they are to completing the signup process by using a progress bar. Completion bias is apparent here - people feel the need to finish what they started.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
506,Skyscraper Technique,"Skyscraper is a tactic created by Brian Dean (Backlinko). As he himself describes it:
Step 1: Find link-worthy content
Step 2: Make something even better Step 3: Reach out to the right people
Create content that's better than everything else what's already been produced on a given topic and capture the backlinks from sites linking to them.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
507,Add secondary CTA,Some users may want to talk first.,Acquisition,,,Low,Yes
508,Multi-Step Forms,Split your long forms into multiple steps to make it feel less daunting to complete. This tactic can have an especially large impact on mobile devices.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
509,Anti-Ad Copy,"Tell users *not* to buy your product. Stand out from all other advertisers who talk about how great their product is. E.g. ""Grammarly? But I no how to right correclty.""",Acquisition,,,Low,No
510,Testimonial Carousel Ads,Testimonials and case studies are the perfect type of content for retargeting ads - when users are familiar with your product and just need that little push to convert. Carousels are a perfect ad format to showcase them e.g. each carousel card shows a case study from a different industry.,Acquisition,,,Low,No
511,Don't Hide Short Forms Behind Buttons,"The problem with hiding short forms is that visitors can't see how easy they would be to fill out. So, instead of hiding them, place them directly on your pages.",Acquisition,,,Low,Yes
512,Decrease Time to Interactive,"The Time to Interactive (TTI) metric measures how long it takes a page to become interactive. Site performance is a ranking factor for search and TTI is one of the most key factors. Various tools' (e.g.
Intercom, Segment, Hotjar) scripts, load in the background and delay TTI. How to decrease TTI and improve site performance:
1) Load the page with no heavy scripts
2) Wait for a scroll event
3) Wait a further second
4) Then load all the heavy scripts
Code snippet to delay script firing: window.addEventListener('scroll', () => setTimeout(()
=> {
// load your scripts here
}, 1000),
{ once: true}
);",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
513,Leverage New Platform Features,"This is a rather general tip. When a social network introduces a new feature (e.g. Facebook Live, LinkedIn's embedded slides), it will increase the reach of posts using these features in order to drive adoption. Don't miss out and always test the new features.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
514,Dimmed Product Background on Signup,"To increase the % of signup form submissions, place the form on top of a dimmed product screenshot.
This will communicate that the end goal is just one click (or form submission) away.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
515,Update Old Content,"Update your old blog content and distribute it again. An extra benefit is that you'll get higher organic CTRs - as Google will display the new published date in SERP (if the content is updated in at least 10%).
Plus, Google likes fresh content so it should get a little SEO boost.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
516,Gated Videos,Use a tool like Wistia to collect leads from your video content. You can either gate the video completely by making the email box required to fill in order to watch the video. Or put the email gate in the middle and offer to sign up to get notified with new content.,Acquisition,,,Low,No
517,Native Ads That Don't Look Like Native Ads,"Use banners that look like elements of your website
e.g. a search box, making users more likely to click them. Make sure to drive them to a page where they can easily continue performing this action for good user experience.
NOTE: such banners will be disapproved on GDN
because they 'mimic a function the ad canʼt perform'.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
518,Autofill Form Fields,"Use Clearbit Forms to automatically fill forms based on enriched data but still leave an option for the user to edit the form input. The less users will have to type, the more of them will complete the form.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
519,Retarget Users Based on Enriched Data,"Use Clearbit Reveal to create retargeting audiences from your website based on e.g. company industry, tech stack, job role, seniority etc. This way you'll be able to run hyper-targeted ads.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
520,Email Validation in Forms,Use e.g. Zerobounce API to disallow invalid and temporary emails from your forms.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
521,Align Search Intent to Content Upgrades,Use Google Search Console to find the phrases users searched for to find your page. Then gather their contact info by offering content upgrades (PDF downloads) closely related to what they exactly needed. This is a sure way to get higher conversion rates than a generic CTA or newsletter subscription would get.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
522,"Personalized Images, Videos and Landing Pages","Use Lemlist to send outreach emails with personalized images and drive traffic to personalized landing pages with copy, images and videos custom to visitor's company. Result: increased email click rates and LP conversion rates thanks to the pattern interrupt.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
523,Stars Rating in Ad Description,Use stars and the number of reviews your product/service has to build credibility with your audience.,Acquisition,,,Low,No
524,Ask a Question in Ad Creative,"Use the ad image to ask a question that arouses users' curiosity, leading to increased CTRs. Make sure to provide a satisfactory answer on the landing page.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
525,Retarget Expensive Traffic on Cheaper Channel,Use the ad platform that allows for the most precise targeting for prospecting. Then retarget this highly targeted traffic using a cheaper channel.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
526,Content Repurposing,Use the content you already have and reach more people by distributing it on new channels. Turn your best performing text content into video/audio/slides/infographics and vice versa.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
527,Review Mining,Use your most satisfied customers' expressions in your copy. Go to a website where you keep your users' reviews and copy some of the best-written phrases they used to describe your product. Your users will often have a better opinion on what your product is for them.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
528,Old Content Syndication,"Use your old blog content that didn't get traction on your blog and offer it as guest posts to other websites. Of course, it has to still be relevant and written by your company's employee. Follow the attached content pruning decision tree by Hubspot.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
529,Switch the Slogan and Tagline,"Very often companies use their slogan as h1 text in their hero section and the actual headline as h2. A slogan usually doesn't help in explaining the product/service well, so it's best to either move it to h2 or not use it in the hero at all. It can be placed e.g. beneath the logo.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
530,Reach Journalists with Facebook/Twitter Ads,"Very often, journalists may be hard to reach by email. Try to target them with Facebook (by job title) or Twitter (by handle) ads instead.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
531,Move Difficult Signup Steps to the End,"Weight of first form fields - make first form fields easiest to fill. Move riskiest, highest friction signup/form steps to the end of the flow to improve completion rates. The cognitive bias behind this tactic is called completion bias - people feel compelled to complete a task once they have started it. Human brain specifically seeks the pleasure completing a task brings.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
532,Problem-Solving Content,What are the tools you use in relation to your niche? What issues users may have related to them that you can write explanations about? By writing helpful content about them you'll get incredibly targeted traffic and show your expertise in a given field.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
533,Remove Slider/Carousel from Hero Section,"Whatʼs wrong with using carousels in the hero section? First, the human eye reacts to movement, and carousels distract us from the one main thing you should convey in the hero. Also, too many messages equals no message. This is known as the clutter effect. And third, they look like banners, which people ignore because they mistake them for ads and generally hate them (banner blindness).
When can hero carousels work though? Ecommerce and travel sites are good examples as they don't want to show only one product/offer.",Acquisition,,,Low,Yes
534,Dimmed Background on Form Fill,"When a user starts filling out a form, dim the rest of the page to get their 100% focus on submitting the form.",Acquisition,,,Low,Yes
535,Exclude All Account Keywords from Dynamic Search Campaigns,"When running Google DSA campaigns (Dynamic Search Ads), make sure to exclude all keywords that you're using in your other campaigns to avoid cannibalization, which drives your CPCs up.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
536,Backlink Return the Favor,When someone reaches out to you asking for a backlink - ask them to return the favor and include your link in one of their articles.,Acquisition,,,Low,No
537,Buy Domain for SEO,"When starting out with a new domain, it's hard to get decent traffic from SEO as your domain authority is 0.
How to speed this up - find another domain (expired or existing) in the same niche as yours and 301 redirect it to your current domain. Your website will inherit all the links and anchor text that the previous site had.
Make sure the new site has a decent Topical Trust Flow similar (topics similar to yours), un-optimized anchor text, and was not used for spam in the past, among others.",Acquisition,,,High,No
538,Get Multiple Backlinks by Sponsoring a Podcast,"You can sponsor a podcast solely for the goal of getting backlinks: from the podcast website + from podcast hosting services (e.g. libsyn), which are high DR do-follow backlinks.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
539,Accelerated Retargeting,"Increase the performance of your retargeting ad campaigns by adjusting the frequency over time.
The more time passes after someone visited your site, the less likely they are to click on your retargeting ad. How can you take advantage of this fact and optimize your retargeting campaign?
Split your campaign into 2-3 ad groups based on the time passed since users visited your site e.g.:
- ad group 1: high frequency, 2-3x/day for the first week after visit
- ad group 2: lower frequency: 1x/day for the next 1 week
- ad group 3: occasional: 1x/every 2-3 weeks
Remember to always take your average time to close a deal into consideration when setting retargeting frequency.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
540,Exchange Facebook Pixel Data,"To reach new Facebook audiences with your ads, you can exchange your pixel data with other advertisers. If there is a company that you know has a similar audience to you but is not a direct competitor, this could be a worthwhile tactic for both of you.
There are a couple of ways to do that:
- share the whole pixel data (details: https://www.facebook.com/business/help/27905999 6069252?id=2042840805783715)
- share an audience (details: https://www.facebook.com/business/help/49929066 3823687?id=2469097953376494)
- Perfect Audience is creating a marketplace for advertisers looking to exchange their pixel data https://www.perfectaudience.com/connect/",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
541,Content Targeted at Users in Transition,"New products are often adopted during periods of transition. Decision-makers starting new roles, end and beginning of budgeting periods, entering a new market, launching a new product etc. Having content targeted at readers in transition helps you convert users with potentially high intent and open to trying new products.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
542,Bundles,"Leverage the audience of other, complementary products (not competing ones) and offer your product bundled with theirs at a discounted price. This allows you to reach a potentially very valuable audience at a low cost. Some examples where this tactic would work well include: newsletters (e.g. https://divinations.substack.com/p/introducing-the- divinations-superorganizers), media sites subscriptions, productivity apps, tools that make up one stack e.g. website builder and no-code membership software.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
543,Integrate with Other Products,"Building integrations with other products is a great way of accessing their user bases. Especially when integrating with a more established product.
The goal here is to improve their users' experience by offering features that the other product doesn't have. When searching for such partnership opportunities, look for features that your customers would find valuable but you're not looking to develop in the near future. The integration has to be beneficial for both parties, as well as more valuable for users than if they were to use the two products independently.
Aspects to consider when evaluating potential partners:
- audience fit: how useful your product will be to
your partner's audience
- potential: how large is their user base
- ease of implementation
Well-known examples include Stripe & Shopify, PayPal & eBay.",Acquisition,,,High,Yes
544,Family Plan/User Bundling,"E-commerce companies use product bundling. Subscription companies use user bundling.
Examples: Spotify, Headspace, or 1Password offering family plans, MasterClass' 1+1 offer.
Combine multiple users into one plan at a single price. The benefit for users is lower subscription price. The benefit for companies is users inviting their friends or families and subscribing to one premium plan. Ideally, you should be able to retain these users longer thanks to the social aspect of the offer - they'll exchange their experiences (MasterClass, Headspace) or compete (if e.g.
MyFitnessPal were to offer such plan), which will make them more engaged with the product.","Acquisition ,Referral",,,Moderate,Yes
545,Leads from Freelance Sites,"Sites like Upwork and Freelancer can be good sources of leads, especially in the early stages of growing your project.
Start by manually looking for:
a) job offers that indicate the job poster might find your product helpful
b) contractors looking for work where your tool could
be of use to them.
Contact job posters by applying to relevant jobs and introducing your product. Contact job seekers by contacting them directly.
If this approach works, you can scale this tactic by using a website monitoring tool that will notify you anytime a specific keyword or phrase is mentioned.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
546,Geo Rollout,"When launching a new product, roll it out on all ad platforms one location/area at a time instead of spreading your ad budget thin. It will allow you to create an impression that your company is bigger than it really is because people will see your ads everywhere. This should be a more efficient way of spending your ad budget.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
547,Influencers Niche Rollout,Sponsor multiple influencers from the same niche at the same time. This will create an impression that your company is bigger than it really is because 'everyone' in your industry is talking about your product.,Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
548,Partner with Course Creators,"Reach new audiences by partnering with course creators.
Find courses that are relevant to your product on sites like Udemy, Skillshare etc. and offer creators an affiliate deal. Share with them revenue from every lead/sale they bring. To make it more effective, give a special offer to students as well.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
549,Pre-Targeting Before Cold Outreach,"How to make your outreach strategy more effective with pre-targeting.
1. Create a custom audience made up with your target accounts - best ad platforms for this are LinkedIn and Twitter as they allow for the most precise targeting (LinkedIn by company name and Twitter by user's handle) - you can even use them both at the same time
2. Run ads targeted at these audiences to build initial brand awareness (optimize for reach)
3. Only after your target audience has been seeing your ads for a couple of days/weeks, start your outreach campaign
Why does it work? Mere exposure effect - people prefer things they're familiar with. When you reach out to them after the pre-targeting campaign, your company is no longer unknown to them.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
550,Buyer's Guide,"When users do extensive research before making a purchase (think B2B and higher-ticket B2C products), you should help them make a decision. A comprehensive buyer's guide will let you capture and convert these high intent audiences.
Answer all the questions a potential buyer may have when looking around for the best solution for their needs. Also, try making it sound as objective as possible as being too salesy will immediately make you lose your credibility.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
551,Playbooks,"Help your prospects understand how to make the most out of your product/service by creating playbooks containing specific tactics for using your product.
If your product is meant to be used by different teams within a company, create a separate playbook for each of them.
This type of content works well not only for lead gen but also in later stages of the funnel, helping users get more value from the product and retain better.
Good examples are Clearbit's playbooks for sales and marketing:
https://clearbit.com/books/data-driven-sales
https://clearbit.com/books/data-driven-marketing","Acquisition,Activation",,,Moderate,No
552,Campaign Performance Feedback,"We all know that the more value a user gets out of your product, the more likely she is to keep using it for a long time. We also know that humans learn best when they get feedback on the actions they take.
How can we use this knowledge to improve the
activation and retention of our products?
Give performance feedback on users' campaigns.
Good examples include HubSpot's Email Health tool and SEMrush's Site Audit tips (see screenshots).
They do a couple of things:
1. Explain what a metric means and why it's important
2. Tell users if their performance is good or bad
3. Give tips on how they can do better
In the early stages of growing your product it also makes sense to offer your help and get on a call to discuss users' results.","Activation, Retention",,,Moderate,Yes
553,Automate Your Outbound Based on G2 Traffic,"G2's premium plan allows you to see who viewed either your or your competitors' review page and how many pages they viewed in total. This gives you super valuable intel on high-intent leads. With this tactic you can automate the outreach process.
Overview of the process:
1. Get lead data from G2
2. Score leads with MadKudu
3. Check if a lead is in your CRM
4. Find a relevant contact
5. Send an email automatically
This tactic requires a couple $k a month budget (for G2 paid plan, MadKudu, and Clearbit), so only makes sense if your deal size is large enough.
Detailed step-by-step instructions here: https://www.madkudu.com/blog/outbound-marketing",Acquisition,,,High,Yes
554,Instant Qualification in Subheadline,Instantly qualify your website visitors by saying who uses your product in the subheadline e.g. 'Loved by bootstrapped SaaS makers' or 'Enterprise sales reps save hours a week with [your product name]'. This gives your visitors an immediate confirmation that they're in the right place to solve their problem.,Acquisition,,,Low,No
555,Personalized Onboarding Videos,"Send custom onboarding videos to your customers (or even trial users if can manage it) to take personalization to the next level.
Do some quick research on them and give some personalized tips based on their tech stack, technographic/demographic data, or any other data point, and make them feel like they're not 'just another number'.
Here's an example welcome video ConvertKit used to send to their customers: https://www.bonjoro.com/g/h5KUfm_aDgJ
As they noticed, 'the magic is in saying their name and noticing something about their work.'",Activation,,,Moderate,No
556,Recover Failed Payments,"Reduce involuntary churn by sending automated messages to customers whose payments didn't go through.
The vast majority of credit cards expire every 36 months, which means about 2.8% of your customers' cards will expire every month. This can lead to over 30% of revenue loss from annual subscriptions every year. The longer your plans are, the higher the chance of CC expirations preventing successful billing.
Another reason for failed payments can be mechanical failures of your tools. Make sure to review the connection points between your merchant provider, bank, and payment processor to alleviate any issues. These types of issues should be easy to avoid.
How to make the renewal emails as efficient as possible:
- remind your customers of the value they've been
getting from your product - include any reports and stats if you can so your request for new payment is justified
- reduce friction as much as possible - include a custom link driving users straight to the payment update page with pre-populated fields
Tools:
https://www.profitwell.com/churn-reduction- software (claims to recover >70% of failed payments) https://baremetrics.com/features/recover https://churnbuster.io/ https://churnkey.co/feature/dunning
The best thing about these tools is that you only pay for performance, so your ROI will always be positive.",Retention,,,Moderate,Yes
558,Co-Branded Content,"Find a complimentary (but not competing) product and create co-branded content together e.g. ebook, report.
Use your collective data and expertise and make the resource extra valuable to both your audiences.
Then, promote the resource together with the partner company to your audiences and share the leads.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
559,Leverage Other People's Networks,"I wrote a whole post with multiple tactics about it: https://www.getscrapbook.com/blog/other-peoples- networks
If you're launching a new product and don't have an existing audience, or if you just want to reach a new, relevant audience, then using other people's networks might be an appealing strategy.
The concept comes from finance, where ""other people's money"" refers to gaining financial leverage by using borrowed capital from banks to increase one's potential returns.
Marketers use this approach to tap into other people's or companies' audiences to get exposure in a relatively cheap way.
In finance, this strategy is a double-edged sword. If an investment levered with other peopleʼs money turns out to be profitable, then the profits are magnified by the effects of the leverage. If it goes wrong, then the losses are amplified by the use of other people's money.
In marketing, if you choose your target right, there's only upside to this approach.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
560,Invite Well-networked Guests on Your Podcast or Webinar,"Using the fact that people share what they're up to on their social channels, you can make them share your content if you invite them on your podcast, webinar, or interview.
Lemlist has been using this strategy with success, hosting webinars with people such as Rand Fishkin, Aaron Ross, or Tim Soulo. They're not only providing great value for their own users but also exposing Lemlist's brand to their target audience at low cost.
And their guests help them with promoting this content.
If you don't run a podcast or webinars and don't plan to, you can get featured on someone else's. Reach out to relevant hosts and offer your input making sure it's aligned with their audience's interests.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
561,Guest Emails,"Find a complimentary (but not competing) product and do a mutual shoutout to both your audiences.
They promote your resource (e.g. ebook) to their subscribers and followers, and in exchange, you share their resource with your audience.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
562,Target Facebook Groups Members,"While it's not possible to target Facebook group members with ads directly through ads manager, there are two workarounds:
#1
Join the group you want to target
Using your business page, create a video that's relevant and valuable to the group audience
Share the video in the group (go to video -> share -> share in a group) (from your personal account) Create a custom audience of people that interacted with it
Target the custom audience with ads
#2
Contact the group admin and ask if they're willing to sell access to any of the custom audiences they've built based on their group members. Here's how it can be done: https://www.facebook.com/business/help/49929066
3823687",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
563,Intent Data for Churn Prevention,"If your customers start reading reviews of your competitors, thereʼs a high chance theyʼre at a churn risk.
But you can prevent it.
Premium version of G2 lets you upload a list of your customers and get notified whenever any of them starts researching other solutions in your space.
What can you do to retain them? Reach out as soon as possible and learn why theyʼre unsatisfied with your product. Then do what needs to be done so that they get the value they expected when choosing your solution – help them with setup or offer extra training.",Retention,,,Moderate,No
564,Interactive Blogpost Quizzes,"Convert more leads from your blogposts by embedding interactive quizzes.
Example: In their article on churn reduction https://paddle.com/blog/reduce-churn Paddle uses relevant quizzes (created with Typeform) to test visitors on how their churn prevention efforts perform. First, they ask them what measures they take to reduce churn at their companies. Then, they collect their business metrics such as MMR, growth and churn rate. And lastly, they collect users' emails so they can send them a report with a score based on their inputs. Of course, there's also a CTA to check out Paddle's churn reduction features.
They use all the data users provide to qualify leads and move them down the funnel.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
565,Personal Campaign Review,"Help users make the most of your product by offering them personal campaign reviews. Have a person e.g. from your CS team analyze a customer's campaign and record a quick video pinpointing the improvements they can make to improve the performance of their campaign.
Better results mean satisfied users, and satisfied users mean higher retention. They'll appreciate the personal touch from your team as well.","Activation, Retention",,,Moderate,No
566,New Plan Resources Notifications,"Reactivate dormant users with new plan resources notifications.
Users who stopped using your product may need an extra push to return. As their (freemium or paid) plan resources get replenished, send a notification (email/push) letting them know that they can use the product again.","Activation,Retention",,,Moderate,No
567,Delightful Thank You Pages,"Go creative and delight your users with custom thank you pages. Not only will they stay in users' minds, but will also have a chance to be shared with others.
2 wonderful examples:
Wistia's thank you page video after booking a demo https://wistia.com/pricing/thanks HubSpot's email unsubscribe page video https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=Lt8p0_Cp76c","Acquisition,Activation,
Retention ,    Referral",,,Moderate,No
568,Offboarding Flow,"Add offboarding to your cancellation process to save some of the churning users and collect qualitative feedback from the rest.
This is one of the few cases where adding (a little) friction is actually a good thing.
Users signed up to your product for a reason - remind them of the value theyʼll lose (data, history, etc.) if they cancel their account (loss aversion).
Then, ask what's the reason they're leaving. Based on their answer, you can offer them a salvage offer and try to retain them.
Some example offers you can make to make them stay:
- Downgrade to a lower pricing plan - if price is the
reason
- Let them pause their account - if price is the reason
- Offer extra training to help them get more value out
of the product - if they didn't get the value they expected
Even if you fail to make them stay, such offboarding flow will let you collect some valuable feedback that will help you make the experience better for other users.
Tools to create customized offboarding flows and offers: brightback.com & churnkey.co",Retention,,,Moderate,Yes
570,Churn Risk Detection,"Identify when a user/account is likely to churn and try to prevent it.
Set up a notification system that will alert you of users who e.g.:
- have a downward product usage trend
- submitted one or two negative NPS scores
- start researching your competitors on G2 (premium plan allows this)
What can you do to retain them? Reach out as soon as possible and learn why they're unsatisfied with your product. Then do what needs to be done so that they get the value they expected when choosing your solution - help them with setup or offer extra training.
Example tool that does this for you on autopilot: https://churnkey.co/feature/customer-health",Retention,,,Moderate,Yes
571,Keyword Ideas from Reddit,"Put the most relevant subreddits to your niche into Ahrefs/Semrush and look for keywords that a given subreddit ranks for highly. As Reddit threads are not keyword-optimized and usually not linked well, there's potential for you to outrank them if you do the on-page optimization right.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
572,Templates,"Give users a warm start and get them up to speed by offering templates for the most common use cases of your product.
Examples include survey templates by SurveyMonkey, email templates by MailChimp, base templates by Airtable etc.
Templates let users get to core product value quicker, increasing the % of users who will be activated.
Also, on the acquisition side, there's potential to rank for template-related phrases in search results.
SurveyMonkey ranks for phrases like questionnaire template, customer survey template, hiring questionnaire template etc.
To make the most out of this traffic, make sure after signing up users land on the selected template so that the experience is highly aligned with what they came for.
How to take this tactic further: create a marketplace for templates, like e.g. Webflow did. This way, users who need templates have a large choice, and the opportunity to get free exposure to Webflow's large user base attracts template creators (designers and agencies) who have a chance to show off their skills and get new business.
Some other examples of companies doing it right: https://miro.com/templates/ https://milanote.com/templates https://www.mural.co/templates?template- categories=all-templates","Acquisition, Activation",,,Moderate,No
574,Using Negative Reviews to Your Advantage,"Turn haters into promoters. Take quotes from some of your negative reviews and use them in your marketing campaigns.
The key is to pick the reviews left by users who are clearly not your target audience.
Snowbird, a ski resort, used some of their one-star reviews left by unsatisfied skiers and positioned the resort as one of the most unforgiving and rewarding mountains out there (see screenshot). Nothing could be more enticing to their target audience than this.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
575,Cold Outreach with Fake Recommendation,Creative cold outreach idea - reach out to your target audience forwarding an email from your team member who seemingly recommended you contact them based on a given reason (see examples from Brex and Paddle in the screenshots).,Acquisition,,,Low,No
576,Bid on Competitors' YouTube Videos,"Grab the attention of users watching YouTube videos about your competitors using in-stream ads.
Google lets you hyper-target your ads to specific videos, which makes it a perfect opportunity to capture some of your competitors' potential or existing users.
With in-stream ads, you can show your ad before, during, or after your competitor's video.
There are two types of in-stream ads you can choose from:
- Skippable ads - after 5 seconds, the viewer can skip the ad, so it's crucial that you make the beginning engaging enough that users will continue to watch it past the 5 seconds point. The cool thing about this ad type is that you only pay when a viewer watches at least 30 seconds of your video (or the full duration of the video if it's shorter than 30 seconds) or interacts with your video, whichever comes first.
- Non-skippable ads - users don't have an option to skip the ad, but you pay for all impressions it gets.
To capture even more real estate with your ads, you can reach users at an earlier step - when they're searching for a video. Using video discovery ads, your banners will show up on YouTube search results pages. Clicking the ad will drive users to your video.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
578,Expert Marketplace,"Help users get more value out of your product by matching them with vetted experts. In other cases, reduce the barrier to entry for users with not enough skills or time.
Create a directory of verified freelancers/consultants who will help your users get up to speed with your product, make them use it more efficiently, or even do all the work themselves.
Let users either browse through the directory or create a request and let experts apply.
Some expert marketplace examples: https://experts.shopify.com/ https://experts.webflow.com/ https://www.livechat.com/marketplace/experts/ https://www.thinkific.com/experts/ https://bubble.io/agencies https://www.mural.co/playmakers https://www.squarespace.com/designer/home",Activation Retention,,,Moderate,Yes
579,Eliminate Dead Ends,"Activate more users by removing any dead end experiences and making sure there's always an obvious next step for users to take.
Before activating a user, your goal is to help him take the core action that leads to establishing a habit.
Dead ends kill users' momentum and decrease the
chance of taking that action.
Always think of how completing one product flow can lead to another feature or use case.
Some great examples in the screenshots.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
580,Buying Out Competitors' Contracts,"If you have enough runway and are looking to aggressively gain market share, offer to buy out contracts from your competitors' customers. You'll have to sacrifice your ACV (annual contract value) but you'll gain valuable customers already using the solution you're offering.
How it works is:
1. Users apply and get verified that they're under a contract with the competitor(s) you specify
2. The remaining value of their subscription is applied as a credit to their account they create with you
3. They're using your product for free until their contract with your competitor runs out (you should decide how long they have to commit to subscribing to your product)
Examples from Gorgias and SavvyCal: https://www.gorgias.com/stimulus/buyout https://savvycal.com/calendly-buyout
(Right-click and open the screenshots in a new tab to see them clearly)",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
581,Align Referral Incentives with User Motivation,"Referral incentives are most effective when they're in line with the user's motivation to use your product.
So don't blindly offer financial incentives because that's what most companies do. Always try to align them with what matters most to your users.
Examples:
- File storage product offering more space
- Mobile game offering in-app items
- Investing app offering money",Referral,,,Moderate,Yes
582,Altruistic Referrals,"Increase the number of referrals made by your users by focusing the reward on the invitee. Humans are more selfless than we tend to think.
So, instead of saying 'Get 1 month free for inviting a friend', say 'Send your friend a 1-month free access (and get 1 month free yourself)'. The second part is optional - test if a one-sided incentive will be enough so you don't unnecessarily reduce your LTV.
Some important points to keep in mind to make your referral program effective:
- Incentivize sharing after a successful action, when user psych is high
- Reduce the friction of searching for friends' emails by using a contact picker that integrates with your address book e.g. using cloudsponge.com
- Reduce friction further by auto-generating a referral email, so your users just need to confirm it. Also, make the default message sound like it's coming from a user and not the brand.
Here's how you can hack together an MVP referral program if you're just starting out with this channel: https://medium.com/startup-grind/how-to-hack- together-a-referral-program-in-less-than-1-hour- 5ebfff5a725a",Referral,,,Moderate,Yes
583,Compare Prices to Users' Current Situation,"Add an extra (fake) tier to your pricing table reminding users how much they're currently paying instead of using your product (and saving).
This tactic uses the principle of price anchoring with a slight twist. Price anchoring means establishing a price point that users can refer to when making decisions. Commonly used examples include discounts (where the original price is the anchor) and SaaS pricing tables where one plan is much more expensive than the other ones.
The larger the difference between available options, the easier the choice.
Teamflow, a virtual office software is using the average cost of renting an office as the anchor. This way, the price of their product seems negligible relative to the office rent cost ($15-25 vs $799).
Teamflow's pricing plan that uses this tactic: https://www.teamflowhq.com/virtual-office-pricing",Acquisition,,,Low,Yes
584,Demo Experiences,"Convert and activate more users by letting them demo your product before signing up.
If the time to get value from your product is short and you're able to show its capabilities right away, it makes sense to reduce this time further by moving the signup to a later step. And the sooner users experience the value, the higher the probability they will retain.
Examples:
Landing page builder using an editable homepage: https://build.mmm.page/ WordPress lets visitors experience their Gutenberg page builder right on the product page: https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/ Spreadsheet software that throws users right into the product experience https://rows.com/","Acquisition,Activation",,,High,Yes
585,Match CTA Copy to Blogpost Content,"Increase the number of signups from your blog by matching the call-to-action copy to blogpost content.
Use specific, contextual CTAs within your content instead of generic ones across the whole blog. This makes readers more confident that your product solves the exact challenge they came to read about thus making them more likely to convert.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
586,Before and After Pages,"Instead of a standard (and very often boring) customer testimonials page, create a before and after page showing how your customers' business or life changed thanks to using your product.
Multiple benefits of such pages:
- They're quicker to read and grasp the difference a product makes than reading a long case study
- They're more compelling as they don't just show the benefit but the transformation of users which is easier for users to imagine
- They're easier to collect - customers don't need to spend an hour filling long testimonial questionnaires or going on calls
Good examples of before and after pages: https://basecamp.com/before-and-after https://www.hugo.team/before-after
(Right-click and open the screenshots in a new tab to see them clearly)",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
587,Show Savings from All-In-One Products,"All-in-one products can make their prices be perceived as more reasonable by displaying on the pricing page all the products that they make redundant.
Show example tools (and their prices) that your product replaces so that users can clearly see the savings associated with choosing it. When they'll be aware of it, your pricing will become more attractive.",Acquisition,,,Low,Yes
588,Honest Trial Paywall,"When users cancel their subscription right after starting the free trial, it's often because they don't want to forget about the end of it and accidentally get charged.
Reduce the anxiety related to subscribing by being transparent and explicitly showing what will happen during the trial. Most importantly, that you'll remind users about their trial coming to an end.
This will help you gain trust and reduce the number of complaints from users who didn't plan on extending their subscription past the free trial.
Of course, don't blindly use this tactic without doing proper user research and learning the main cause of cancellations.
Here's a great case study on how Blinkist used this tactic to increase their trial signups (+23%), reduce user complaints (-55%), and greatly increase push notification opt-ins (from 6% to 74%, crazy!): https://uxplanet.org/how-solving-our-biggest- customer-complaint-at-blinkist-led-to-a-23- increase-in-conversion-b60ad514134b","Acquisition,Retention",,,Moderate,Yes
589,Intent Data for Cold Outreach,"Intent data is all the behavioral signals indicating that a company is underway the buying cycle.
Some very useful sources of such signals come from tech changes, new job openings, new hires, funding announcements, new partnerships, product launches, awards, expansions to new markets, etc.
Some examples of how these signals can be used in cold outreach:
New job openings. A company hiring in a given department is a sign it's in a good position to invest more in this area of its business. This creates an outreach opportunity for products from that field (job descriptions offer extra insights on the specifics).
New hires. After a person switches jobs, they're likely to introduce new products into their new company - either adopting new ones or replacing existing ones because of personal preference (especially if they're in leadership roles).
Tech changes. Dropping a product from a company's stack opens up the opportunity for a
replacement. There's a chance they weren't satisfied with their previous solution and are willing to try another one. Adopting a new piece of software is a signal that a company may need a complimentary one. Based on your technographic research of your customers, find out what other software your product is most often used together with.
Product launches. Launching a new product means that a company is looking to grow its market share in that area. If your product can facilitate that, there's a chance they'll need it. Researching other products. Premium plan of G2 (starts at about $10k/year) lets you see which companies visited either your product listing, competitors' listings, or a given product category page.
Leading tools providing intent data are predictleads.com and bombora.com
I also wrote a whole article on the topic of intent data a while back: https://www.getscrapbook.com/blog/buyer-intent- data",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
591,Usage Cap on Lower Pricing Tiers,"Add a usage limit to your free or lower-priced tiers so that users can naturally upgrade their subscription after experiencing value from your product.
Examples include Zoom's 40-minute call limit on their free plan or DocuSign's 5 docs/month limit on their lowest paid plan.
This tactic is one of the components of creating a high-performing value-based pricing strategy (charging based on the value users are getting rather than based on features).",Revenue,,,Moderate,Yes
592,Ungate Features That Drive Collaboration and Engagement,"Put the features that drive engagement and collaboration in your free plan to fuel your product's acquisition and expansion revenue.
Examples of such features include sharing (great for driving casual contact viral loops) and integrations with internally used products such as Slack (great for pulling more team members into the product).
To make it easier to understand the potential impact of this tactic, imagine if Miro or Figma gated their sharing features.",Revenue,,,Moderate,Yes
593,New Feature Trials,"Increase the % of users who get activated and upgrade their plans by offering your newly-launched features to all userbase as a free trial.
How this tactic can affect different types of users: For dormant and non-activated users, you're creating another chance for getting them activated.
For activated users, it's an opportunity to get them hooked on a higher plan's value. By having access to the new feature for a limited time, they can see what they're missing out on if they don't upgrade.","Activation,Revenue",,,Moderate,Yes
594,Linkbuilding with Search Ads,"Scale your backlink acquisition efforts by running search ads to your link-worthy content (stats and original research, expert quotes, infographics etc.).
Ahrefs came up with the concept of 'vicious circle of SEO' which says that:
1.  People search for something and read the #1 result
2.  Some of them link to that content
3.  Thanks to these backlinks, the page stays at the top of the search results
...and the loop repeats.
Which led to the idea that paying for the exposition at the top of SERP may be a viable source of new backlinks.
Main benefits:
May be cheaper than manual outreach Mostly passive (you'll still need to manually analyze the attribution by checking which of
the newly acquired backlinks contain the 'gclid' parameter)
Side benefit:
Some of the traffic will perform other actions such as trial and newsletter signups which will further increase the campaign ROI
Challenge:
Attribution - only some % of backlinks will be directly attributable to your search campaign
Here's Ahrefs' full video case study: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz2bGhdnJN0",Acquisition,,,Low,No
596,Use Case Transition,"Accelerate habit formation by adding new use cases to your product.
Products with infrequent use cases (e.g. yearly) are in danger of being forgotten about when the next chance to use them happens. Such companies end up re-acquiring users, which is expensive.
The solution to this problem is adding more use cases around your product to stay top of mind of users.
For example, a user sending yearly customer satisfaction surveys using SurveyMonkey is likely to forget about the product next time she needs to run a survey and may choose a competitor. To stay top of mind, SurveyMonkey transitions users to weekly/monthly customer research surveys which helps build a habit.
Adding new use cases is not cheap. Often requires creating a whole new product or a lot of user education. But for the long-term growth of products with infrequent use cases, adding another use case is very often necessary.
Other examples from companies that solved this challenge successfully:
Zillow - main use case: buying home (yearly+ frequency) → new use case: Zestimate score (monthly frequency)
Credit Karma - main use case: tax filing (yearly frequency) → new use case: credit monitoring (monthly frequency)
S/o to Reforge for coming up with this insight.","Activation ,Retention",,,High,No
598,Pricing Page GIFs,"Increase the number of signups from the pricing page by adding GIFs to the pricing plan tooltips. This will help users easily understand your product's features without having to leave the page.
Here's a great example of this tactic in action: https://blackmagic.so/membership/
Instructions on how to implement it.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,Yes
599,Don't Require Email Verification on Signup,"Don't make users verify their emails on signup unless there's a security reason for it.
It's a friction point in the signup experience that risks getting the user distracted after she leaves the flow and causes drop-off (not to mention the cases  where the confirmation emails are delayed or not delivered because of technical reasons).
If there is a valid reason to require users to verify their emails, move this step as far as possible in the flow. Ideally, right before users perform the sensitive action.",Activation,,,Low,No
600,Personal Communication,"Increase the reply rate of your feedback requests by making your communication more personal.
People prefer to interact with other people, not bots or generic support emails. So including a personal touch in your message might be the extra push needed to make users reply to you.
The attached screenshot from Airtable is a great example. When asking for feedback on my experience with their support, they included 3 elements making the interaction more personal:
Person's image
Person's name Person's short bio","Activation, Retention",,,Low,No
601,Right Choice Confirmation,"During onboarding, reassure users your product is a good fit for their needs based on the choices they've made in the previous steps of the flow.
For example (based on the screenshots from the Loona app), if users signed up for your product hoping it will help them sleep and feel better, confirm that's the outcome other users like them get from using the app (and show proof).
Being aware that they're in the right place, users' motivation levels will stay high, which will increase the chance they'll successfully complete the onboarding flow.
To back up your claims, you can use either stats from similar users of your product (recommended) or relevant industry data (e.g. sales teams using lead enrichment software close 25% more leads).",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
602,Avoid Paid Individual Plans,"Focusing on team plans rather than individual plans will lead to increased retention rate and more expansion revenue.
Individual user companies have similar unit economics to B2C: low retention and a high support burden. For this reason, they can be useful to generate leads, but their long-term revenue potential is much lower than team plans.
Aspects of team products resulting in much better unit economics:
Higher engagement with the product → no single user can easily make the decision to churn.
Collaboration provides constant opportunities for reactivation (via engagement of other users)
→ lower chance of dormant users.
More users using the product means opportunity for expansion revenue and negative churn.",Revenue,,,Moderate,No
603,Create a Shared Enemy,"Identify and align your company against a shared enemy (behavior, belief, or shared philosophy) to create a sense of belonging in people who stand for the same values.
Examples: Signal vs companies neglecting usersʼ privacy, Typeform vs forms, Airtable vs spreadsheets.
The social identity theory says that the groups people belong to offer both identity (they tell us who we are) and self-esteem (they make us feel good about ourselves). And humans have a need to identify with groups in such a way as to maximize their uniqueness.
Fighting a shared enemy helps meet this need, creating brand loyalty as a result.
Note: this tactic is a much better fit for ‘painkillerʼ products (solving a problem) rather than ‘vitaminʼ products (that are nice-to-have).
Extra tip: give out swag related to these values, as a part of the movement.","Acquisition,Retention  ,   Referral",,,Moderate,No
604,Length Implies Strength Heuristic,"Length implies strength heuristic says that the more you have to say, the more likely it is people will believe you.
So to make any kind of marketing content (ads, landing pages, emails) more persuasive and credible, load it with more words, benefits, testimonials, images, and even spacing.
This makes your audience say “Wow...look how much is here. It must be true.”
Examples of this heuristic in action: https://launchschool.com/love https://basecamp.com/customers Basically any info productʼs landing page",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
605,Environment Habit Loops,"Accelerate the natural process of habit formation by creating an environment habit loop - placing visual cues near where the organic trigger occurs.
For many products, it's not possible to predict when users will experience the problem (or make them need the product at a given time) but it is possible to know in what situation it will happen.
Placing environmental triggers in their way makes it more likely that they'll take the action, get the reward, and thus complete the habit loop more often. Which makes it more likely they'll develop a habit around the product.
So to implement an environment habit loop, consider:
1.  In what situations users experience the need to
use your product
2.  How you can place something in their view to help them take the action that leads to a reward
Most common ways of creating environment loops include building browser extensions, establishing partnerships, and buying ads.
Examples:
Zoom - the trigger to use the product often occurs when users schedule a meeting in their calendar, so Zoom built a browser extension to make this action easier.
HubSpot - the trigger appears when users do
manual sales activities in their email, so HubSpot created a Gmail plugin that makes completing these tasks more convenient.
Loom - the trigger appears when users need to explain some process to someone else, so Loom created partnerships with Jira and Upwork, and also made their browser plugin display a widget on Google Sheets.
Uber and Lyft created a partnership with Google that allows them to display their ride offers exactly when users are searching for transportation (in Google Maps).
Buffer and Pinterest built browser extensions that display a button on any website's image, giving users an easy way to schedule (Buffer) or pin them (Pinterest).
S/o to Reforge for coming up with this concept.","Activation,Retention",,,High,Yes
607,Trial For All Freemium Users,"Increase the free to paid conversion rate by making the premium plan trial obligatory to all users signing up for the free plan.
By having more users experience the full range of features your product has to offer, a higher % of them will see the value and need for the features not available in the free plan.
At the end of the trial, remind them of the features they won't have access to if they don't upgrade (inducing loss aversion bias).
Also, let them know that if they don't take any action, they'll still be able to use the free plan of your product.
Note: this tactic makes sense only for products using feature-based pricing. Those with usage-based pricing (e.g. Dropbox charging users primarily based on storage) most likely won't benefit from applying  it.","Activation,Revenue",,"SaaS, Collaborative, App, Game",Low,Yes
608,Success States,"Let users know they've completed an action successfully using success states (also called confirmation states).
Success states are UI elements of interactions that let users know that they're on the right track or already achieved a goal.
Examples: message sent successfully, task completed, workflow activated.
The peak-end rule suggests that humans judge experiences based on how they felt at the peak moments, as well as how they felt at the end.
So making the success states satisfying will increase the probability of users repeating the action, strengthening the habit loop.
A success state must clearly communicate the confirmation message that reflects the scale of the action.
So, sending an email in Gmail (action that users do multiple times every day) will trigger a small notification in the corner of the page but publishing a new landing page should be much more pronounced
e.g. a full-screen popup.
Success states can be used to simply signal the end of the flow (inbox zero in Superhuman) or be both the confirmation of goal completion and show users a natural next action you want them to take.","Activation,Retention",,,Moderate,Yes
610,Find Expiring Annual Contracts,"Use BuiltWith to find companies whose annual contracts with your competitors expire soon. Here's how to do it.
Based on this intel, reach out to them offering your product as a superior solution. Pitch them the key advantages over your competitor.
The fact that these companies are already using a similar product means that they have a problem they need solving and if your product can do it better/easier/cheaper, they may be willing to switch providers.
Things to consider:
Adjust the time of reaching out based on both the notice period of the competing product and your average lead close rate. So e.g. if the notice period is 1 month and your avg close rate is 1 month, reach out at least 2 months before their contract ends so that they have enough time to cancel.
Offer free migration (if necessary) to lower the friction.
Offer your product for free until their contract with your competitor ends.
Don't mention you know when their contract expires - it will sound too shady.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
612,Even If' Copywriting Technique,"Remove readers' objections using an 'even if' copywriting technique to make them more willing to convert.
Generic formula: {Achieve desirable outcome} even if {objection}
Example: Build powerful automations even if you can't code
Your prospects always have certain doubts and uncertainties when researching the right solution for their needs. You should be aware of them and remove them from their path to conversion.
Using the 'even if' technique, you can proactively mention these objections to make users know you're aware of them and that your product can handle them.
Also, being upfront about it gives you an advantage over your competitors who don't mention it.",Acquisition,,,Low,No
613,Reward Reminders,"Build stronger retention by reminding users of the value they're getting from your product. Seeing tangible results will make them want to stick with it for longer and make them more likely to upgrade.
Making users aware of the value they got is the crucial third step of the habit loop (reward), especially important for products where users don't see the reward immediately after using them (e.g. tools working in the background).
Examples:
Loom shows how much time users saved by replacing meetings with Looms
Automation tools (e.g. Zapier) should show the estimated time users saved thanks to their processes being automated
Tools that save money should display the amount of money users saved thanks to them
For the reward to be most effective, the results you're showing must be in line with users' end goal of using your product (e.g. if users use Zapier to save time, it wouldn't make sense for Zapier to display how many tasks it automated for them because it's not what users came for).","Retention,Revenue",,,Moderate,Yes
614,Precommitment,"Help users build stronger habits around your product and improve retention by using precommitment.
Asking users to commit to a goal will help them follow through on their word and make them use your product consistently.
Examples:
Duolingo asking users to select a learning streak goal (see screenshot).
Coursera asking users to set weekly learning
goals.
Budgeting apps asking users to set a saving goal over a period of time.
Users' motivation is usually at its peak when signing up. Use it to make them pick an ambitious goal which will make them more likely to stay on track thanks to the commitment bias - our tendency to stay committed to our past behaviors even if they don't have desirable outcomes.
Two important things to keep in mind. First, make the goal about the input (what users can control), and not the output (the result). Second, the goal you're asking users to set should be their own choice - check out this experiment by  Duolingo.
How to make it even more effective:
Encourage users to share their commitments on social platforms or by creating accountability groups. Committing to a goal publicly puts a little pressure on them that helps them stick to their goals.
Whenever relevant, make users sign their name in the app (see screenshot). Signing makes them more likely to commit to their goal through the self-signaling effect (humans can influence their own self-beliefs through their actions).","Activation ,Retention",,,Moderate,Yes
616,Keyword Shortcuts,"Implement keyword shortcuts to help users be more efficient with your product thus increasing their retention.
Using the keyboard is the fastest way to navigate most modern software products for users familiar with them. And the time savings from doing so without shifting hand position compounds over time.
Very often (when shortcuts are available), super users are keyboard-only.
The benefit is that making users more efficient makes your product more valuable to them, and as a result, theyʼre more likely to retain. It also increases the cost of switching to another tool as they will not want to lose their levels of productivity.
There are 3 parts to a command palette:
1.  A shortcut to open the palette (very often ctrl/cmd + k)
2.  Fuzzy matching logic to easily find commands
3.  A way to see the keyword shortcuts so that users can use them directly next time
An out-of-the-box tool that lets you implement keyboard shortcuts and more: CommandBar.",Retention,,,Moderate,Yes
617,Competitor vs Competitor Comparison,"Capture high-intent traffic by creating content comparing your competitors and including your own product in the mix.
Users searching for tool comparison content are at the decision-making stage of choosing a tool, so this type of posts tend to be high-converting if you can grab users' attention.
It's also a great tactic if there is not much search volume for phrases comparing you to your competitors yet (that's when you can use tactic #105, Competitor Comparison Pages).
Podia executed this tactic exceptionally well (example 1, example 2):
They mention their product right from the start. They begin with a convenient comparison table where their product is included and looks like the best option.
The comparison that follows is very in-depth. After describing each of their competitors' features, pros, and cons, they do the same thing about their own product.
There's a side-by-side comparison of Podia with each of the two competing tools individually.
There's a Podia free signup CTA after each section.
Crisp (while didn't optimize their content well for conversion) created 463 such pages, for a combination of each of their competitors: https://crisp.chat/en/comparisons/.",Acquisition,,,Moderate,No
619,Data Import in Onboarding,"Help users get activated quicker by letting them easily import their data from other tools during the onboarding process.
Users moving from other tools are usually high-value as they have a proven need for the product, plus they already know what to do with it.
Providing an easy migration process during onboarding will decrease the setup time (and time to value), which in turn will make users more likely to retain for longer.
For users with high expected LTV, it makes sense to offer it even if your team will have to do it manually (see Tactic #171: Concierge Migration).","Activation,Retention",,,High,Yes
620,Programmatic SEO,"Programmatically create landing pages at scale to rank for a large number of long-tail keywords.
Programmatic SEO can be a much more efficient way of generating high-intent organic traffic than manually writing each page's content.
Examples:
Zapier programmatically created tens of thousands of pages for all their integrations (Connect product 1 & product 2) (example page).
G2 used their own data + user-generated content to create tens of thousands of comparison pages (example) and 'alternative to' pages (example),
Rocketreach ranks for 1M+ pages with their
{person name}  email, { company}  details, and
{ company } email format pages.
How to do it (summary):
1.  Come up with head terms - the short-tail keywords related to your product that users may search for, e.g. Best Webflow apps
2.  Find modifiers - the keywords that will let you create specific high-intent phrases your potential users may search for, e.g. Best Webflow {modifier} apps -> Best Webflow contact form apps, Best Webflow popup apps, Best Webflow automation apps, etc.
3.  Gather data - you can use your own product data (like Zapier and Rocketreach), user- generated content (like G2), freely accessible datasets and APIs (like this, this, or this), scrape data from other sources, or use VAs (for smaller datasets). Or, a combination of the above.
4.  Generate page template(s) and programmatically fill it with content.

623,Conditional Freemium,"Activate more free plan users using a time-limited onboarding checklist. Allow them to keep using the free version of the product only if they complete the checkpoints in time. If not, they can start a free trial of a higher subscription plan.
The assumption here is that the drop in free plan users will be offset by:
a) higher activation rate of those who complete the
checklist (and who have a higher chance of upgrading to a paid plan in the long run)
b) higher % of users who go through the trial of a higher subscription plan",Activation,,,High,Yes
624,Avoid Hard Stops,"Paywall the resources users create above their plan limits and use them as an incentive to upgrade their subscription.
Imagine a scenario where you're using Loom's free plan with a 5-minute recording limit but you're cut off at the 5-minute mark without being able to capture everything you wanted to say.
You'd probably be pissed as you'd have to either:
a) Start from scratch and try to squeeze the content into the 5-minute limit.
b) Upgrade your plan and have to record the video from scratch anyway.
Now, imagine if instead of cutting you off, Loom would let you finish recording, gated your fully recorded video with a paywall, and let you upgrade to unlock it.
You'd now be grateful to Loom for letting you go over your plan limits which would make you more likely to upgrade your subscription plan.
The same idea applies to any other type of product where you can allow users to exceed their plan limits without incurring significant costs.",Revenue,,,Moderate,Yes
625,Custom App Icons,"Fight notification badge fatigue by customizing your home screen app icon based on the type of notification.
Instead of overloading users with more and more notification badges, slightly modify your app icon to stand out from the crowd and increase the number of users that return to the app.",Retention,,,Moderate,Yes
626,Build vs Buy Calculator,"Help users decide to buy your software by showing them the true cost of building and maintaining a custom solution vs subscribing to your tool.
When evaluating software—especially if they're technical—users might think, “Yeah I could just build this myself.” But is it really worth it once you factor in time, effort, and opportunity cost?
A buy vs. build calculator can remove any hesitations by making the costs crystal clear, helping them realize that a custom internal tool isnʼt worth the hassle.
Some good examples: https://keygen.sh/build-vs-buy/ https://ideanote.io/tool/build-vs-buy-idea- management

627,Create a Viral Signup Process,"Working in SaaS, you know sign-up forms are a critical step in your user acquisition funnel. But why settle for the standard “name and email” fields when you can transform your sign-up into a viral growth engine? Instead of collecting the usual contact details, encourage new users to share your sign-up form with a few friends. By integrating social sharing tools and keeping the referral ask minimal—say, just 2–3 shares—you’ll remove most of the friction. The result? A surge in new signups that compounds with every referral.",Awareness,,,Moderate,Yes
628,Discounts for Shares,"Social proof can be hard to come by - unless you incentivise it.

To grow your social media following, and attract new visitors to your website, try offering a 5% or 10% discount for users that share your landing page on Twitter, LinkedIn or Like your Facebook page.",Activation,,,Moderate,No
629,Targeted Press Releases,"Press coverage may seem old fashioned, but getting your story published in TechCrunch or Venture Beat could have a huge impact on your growth. Be smart about your outreach, and you stand a decent chance of success:

Write a short and sweet press release.
Focus on the story of your brand.
Personally reach out to a small number of relevant journalists.
",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
630,Free User Accounts for Bloggers,"Popular bloggers can be just as influential as press coverage - and their audiences represent an untapped resource of potential users.

Reach out to the biggest bloggers in your industry, and offer them a free paid account in exchange for a review. They'll share the review with their own audience, and likely funnel a whole ton of new traffic towards your product.

""Popular bloggers can be just as influential as press coverage""
","Awareness, Acquisition",,,Low,No
631,Build an Influencer List,"If you want to grow your audience quickly, network with people with established audiences.

Create a list of influential figureheads in your industry, and start engaging with their content, commenting on their ideas, and when you've established a rapport, sharing your own content with them.

Your chosen influencers need to:

Have an audience that matches your buyer persona.
Be able to benefit from your content. ",Awareness,,,Low,No
632,Influencer Outreach,"A personalised email is still one of the best ways to engage with your influencers. When you have a blog post, infographic, eBook or free trial you want to promote, send each person on your list a tailor-made email.

Influencers are busy people, so you'll need an intriguing subject line to stand-out in a crowded inbox. From there, make your email concise, demonstrate your knowledge of the influencer ('I was reading your latest blog post...') and explain why your product/offer/resource is relevant to their audience.",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
633,Get Listed on a Startup Directory,"Whilst the days of web directories are long behind us, you still can increase the reach of your business by listing yourself on some of the SaaS industry's biggest and best startup directories.

Choose directories that are big, popular and industry relevant. Though niche directories will expose your brand to fewer people, they'll increase your chances of attracting interested people (be it new visitors or even potential investors) to your business.
",Awareness,,,Low,No
634, Leverage Q&A Sites,"Question and Answer sites have quickly become some of the largest online networks at our disposal. With an estimated monthly userbase in excess of 9 million people, Quora is one of the largest - and you can use it to generate a ton of engaged, relevant traffic for your business.

When used cautiously, Quora can be a powerful tool for improving SEO.
It offers a soapbox for developing thought-leadership.
It lets you engage potential customers in discussion, and discover what they want from your product.
It lets you raise awareness for your product, and drive targeted traffic back to your website.","Awareness, Acquisition",,,Moderate,No
635,Industry-Specific Q&A Sites,"In addition to sites like Quora and Reddit, it's relatively easy to find a handful of specialised, industry-specific Q&A sites in virtually any niche.

Whilst actively engaging people on these sites is unlikely to generate an abundance of new customers (after all, they're likely to be people in the same line of business as yourself), they're fantastic for securing new links, and raising awareness for your company.

In terms of SaaS growth hacking, there are a few of particular significance:

Inbound.org - HubSpot's inbound marketing-focused platform.
GrowthHackers.com - a Q&A site dedicated entirely to the noble art of growthhacking.
Stackoverflow - a world renowned Q&A site for developers.",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
636,Build Your Own Q&A Site,"Given the obvious benefits of Q&A engagement, why not develop your own site? There are a multitude of platforms available for developing your own Q&A site in a cost-effective way. OSQA and Askbot offer open source tools for developers to build-upon; and SaaS companies like Answerbase and Qhub offer a good-to-go cloud-based platform.
To get your site up-and-running, it's essential to:

Boost visibility by making your site as search friendly as possible.
Use existing Q&A sites to promote your new one.
Incentivise user contributions with rewards and increased recognition.
Start with 'editorial seeding' - using your own team to ask, answer and share questions. 
Specialise, and focus your site around a niche industry",Awareness,,,High,Yes
637,Create an FAQ Section,"Everyday you're asked questions about your start-up, its software, and how to get the most from it. One growth hack you can implement to leverage this data is building an FAQ section into your website.

Ensure that the entire team is taking note of all the questions they get asked by customers and prospects throughout the day, and keep a tally of how often they're mentioned. The most frequent questions can then be published to your FAQ section.

With each FAQ given its own page, this offers an additional opportunity to highly rank pages in organic search listings like Google's. It also reduces the time your sales/customer service time spend answering the same questions, and promotes trust, increasing conversions.",Awareness,,,Moderate,Yes
638,Acquire Early Adopters With Hacker News,"Hacker News is a breeding ground for tech enthusiasts and early adopters. You probably even check it out yourself.

It's a thriving community of entrepreneurs who can provide you with valuable feedback on your product. They're usually not afraid to be brutally honest, but make great early adopters that can help you shape your product.

The best way to leverage Hacker News for early publicity is actually quite simple. Just post ""Ask HN: Review my startup, xyz.com"". After you've posted, engage with the feedback you receive and get a discussion going without being defensive.",Awareness,,,Low,No
639,"The 2,000 Follower Hack 
","If you want to build a big social media following, as quickly as possible, Twitter is the place to do it.

A new account is allowed to follow up to 2,000 users. Start by following relevant users from accounts similar to your own (competitors, partners, industry news outlets etc.), until you hit your limit. Then, periodically unfollow users that haven't followed you back - and follow new, relevant users in their place.

As long as you do this gradually, you won't fall foul of Twitter's fair usage rules. You'll earn follow backs, and even find your account recommended by Twitter -  and you'll be able to grow your account to 2,000 relevant followers extremely quickly.",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
640,The Skyscraper Technique,"Linkbuilding is hard, but it's an important part of optimising your website for search engines. Without links, quite simply, your web pages aren't going to be showing up in Google's more competitive search results.

One tactic to attract links to your website is what's known as the Skyscraper technique, and it's amazingly simple:

Find a piece of content on another website relevant to yours which has been shared and linked to a lot.
Publish a piece of content to your own website that is much better (longer, more detailed, better presented)
Reach out to all the people that linked to and shared that content, telling them about your piece
It's amazingly effective, and an excellent way to win the links you need to grow your search traffic.",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
641,Integrate with Popular Apps,"Whilst we're on the topic of integration, you can make efforts to integrate your SaaS product with other popular applications. Intermediaries like Zapier make this process relatively painless, allowng you to integrate and promote your product to the users of established SaaS giants like MailChimp, Trello and DropBox.

In doing so, you can harness the massive user bases of existing businesses to grow your own users. You'll make your existing users' lives even easier, and even be able to promote your product on the Zapier application directory.

",Awareness,,,Moderate,Yes
642,Repurpose Your Content,"Content assets (like guides, whitepapers and eBooks) offer a ton of lead-generating potential - but they can be costly and time-consuming to produce. With that in mind, it makes sense to squeeze every last drop of marketing benefit from each piece of content you create,

That's where repurposing comes in - using your existing content to create tons of brand new content, in a cost-effective way. A single eBook can easily become:

A dozen blog posts
An epic infographic
A webinar
A series of YouTube videos
A SlideShare
A series of markeitng emails",Awareness,,,Moderate,No
643,LinkedIn InMail Outreach,"If your target audience regularly use LinkedIn, it's time to explore the world of InMails. LinkedIn's paid accounts offers its users a limited number of direct messages to other LinkedIn members, even if you aren't connected to them. Best of all, these InMails, guarantee you a response - and if you don't hear back, your credit is refunded to try again.

To get the most of this private introduction service, try creating a short and sweet InMail template. To stand out in a crowded inbox, keep it concise, honest, and to-the-point. Don't jump straight to a sales-focused pitch, and instead, try and offer your prospect some form of benefit: a free consultation, eBook or bit of personalised advice.",Awareness,,,High,No
644,The Hail Mary Offer,"If some of your pages suffer from a big bounce rate (a high number of people immediately exiting the page), enlist the help of an exit intent popup.

When your visitor goes to click the back button, hit them with a message promoting a free guide or resource. If it's got broad appeal, there's a chance they might just engage with it, and give you their email address.",Acquisition,,,Low,Yes
645,Use Micro Conversions to Drive Macro Conversions,"Most conversion goals (downloading an eBook, subscribing to the blog) are actual macro conversions - big milestones that represent an important part of the lead nurturing process.

To reach a macro conversion, our visitors have to complete a series of micro conversions - things like visiting sales-focused webpages, or interacting with other users. By monitoring micro conversions, you'll have a much better idea of the sales-readiness of your leads - and you'll find it much easier to engage them with an offer or demo.",Acquisition,,,Low,Yes
646,User Customised Social Sharing Icons,"Social share bars (like Buffer's awesome Digg Digg) make it quick and easy for visitors to share your content, promote it to their networks, and attract new visitors.

Whilst it's always good to include the likes of Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn, you can lose out on precious shares by failing to include some of the more obscure social networks - or by overcrowding your share bar with dozens of icons.

Thankfully, AddThis has a smart solution: a dynamic social share bar that uses JavaScript to identify which networks each visitor actually uses.",Referral,,,Low,Yes
647,The Commitment Checkbox,"The humble checkbox can be a powerful tool for driving conversions. By adding a checkbox to a landing page, or even a homepage signup form, you're asking your visitor to make a small and simple commitment to your brand.

Once they've ticked next to a benefit-focused button (something along the lines of 'Yes! I'm ready to start saving time today!'), they've enlisted the psychological power of comittment and consistency - making them much more likely to successfully continue with their form submission.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
648,The Serial Position Effect,"If you want your visitor to take a particular course of action, or learn a particular lesson, make sure it's the last and first thing they read.

Whenever we read a list, our brain subconsciously prioritises the first and last items on it - often relegating the middle items to relative obscurity. If you're trying to encourage your visitors to download an eBook, capitalise on this by using a bullet point list, and reinforcing your strongest benefits in first and last position.",Activation,,,Low,No
649,The Illusion of Truth Effect,"Another simple way to reinforce a message is to repeat it. The more we find ourselves exposed to a message, the more familiar it becomes. This triggers a heuristic known as the Illusion of truth - where we find ourselves more likely to trust and believe the message through sheer virtue of its familiarity.

This is hugely useful in all manner of marketing contexts - allowing your business to reinforce its value proposition. and those of its free resources and downloads, by simply repeating a core message.",Activation,,,Low,No
650,Sales Funnel Sensitive Landing Pages,"This is a small tip with huge implications for your conversion rates. In simple terms, your landing pages shouldn't be a one-size-fits-all offer. Visitors will come to your website through all manner of different channels, looking for all different types of information. In order to maximise the chances of securing a conversion, you need to tailor your offers to their individual needs, and create multiple landing pages.

Your landing pages should consider:

Buyer persona. What are their basic needs and pain points?
Channel. Where did your visitors come from?
Sales Funnel Stage. Are they looking to buy, or in need of some basic information?
Past Engagement. Have they downloaded other offers before?",Acquisition,,,High,Yes
651,Sales Funnel Social Proof,"Social proof is an essential part of fostering the trust of consumers; allowing people to see how your products and services are being used by happy, satisfied people, to solve the same types of problems they have.

However, the efficacy of social proof lies in its use. Instead of creating a dedicated 'testimonials' page, it's a much better idea to incorporate social proof into your sales funnel. By including testimonials, reviews and quotes on your landing pages, product and pricing pages, you encourage potential customers to trust your brand at the one point it really matters - just before a sales decision.","Activation, Revenue",,,Moderate,Yes
652,Anchored Pricing,"Our attitudes towards prices can be influenced by a myriad of different factors - most notable being the context in which we engage with prices.

For example, a £100 shirt seems expensive compared to a £50 shirt; but place that same shirt next to a £2000 suit, and suddenly, it doesn't seem so costly.

You can easily leverage this by opening your pricing page with your most expensive option; making all your other packages seem more affordable in comparison, and driving up the average spend.
","Activation, Revenue",,,Low,No
653,Left Digit Anchoring,"Prices ending in 9 sell, on average, 24% better than the nearest rounded price point. This is usually attributed to the way our brains subconsciously understand numbers, using the left-hand digit to set the reference for the rest of the number.

By ending a number in 9, instead of 0 (say £39 instead of £40), we're encouraging the brain to subconsciously associate the price with the lower reference point (£30, instead of £40) - and making the decision to buy a little bit easier.

","Activation, Revenue",,,Low,No
654,Decoy Price Points,"By introducing seemingly useless price points into your pricing structure, it's possible to frame your highest price points in a more desirable way.

The classic example is The Economist's pricing strategy, where the introduction of an undesirable price point actually drove an increase in revenue of 30%. If you're operating a tiered SaaS pricing strategy, it's extremely easy to incorporate this practice into your own pricing.","Activation, Revenue",,,Low,Yes
655,The Less is More Product Page,"The more products you offer, the harder it is to choose between them. With too many products and options to choose between, there even comes a point where decision making can grind to a halt.

This is known as 'option paralysis', a state where consumers will become overwhelmed by choice, and quit out of the buying process. To avoid this, and optimise your product page to increase sales, focus all of your energies on promoting a handful of key product types.",Activation,,,Low,Yes
656,The Competitor Comparison Page,"Direct comparisons between rival products is a crucial part of the buying process. Whilst many businesses choose to pretend these comparisons don't happen, and tout themselves as the only viable solution, it's far more productive to actually facilitate these comparisons.

By making direct comparisons between your software and your competitor's (like HubSpot do with rivals Marketo), you can highlight your own strengths, their weaknesses, and take control of a crucial part of the buying process.",Activation,,,Moderate,Yes
657,Send Behaviour-Based Emails,"There's lots of ways to contact existing customers, and keep them in the loop. Many SaaS companies get this wrong, however, choosing to send generic emails out to all subscribers, rather than tailoring content and notifications based on behaviour.

Behaviour-based emails are a great SaaS growth hack that can help you to retain more revenue and customers, and it's pretty simple. First, you want to get setup with a piece of software like Intercom or Autosend. These pieces of software track how your users are using your application, and give you the ability to send out custom messages based on their behaviour.

For example, you could send an email out to someone who hasn't logged in after a month, asking if they need help. For someone that's using the software frequently, and taking lots of ""manual"" steps, you might email them to let you know there's a premium feature that could reduce their time spent in the software, and help them to get work done faster if they upgraded.
","Retention, Referral",,,Low,No
658,Track Your Users' Success Milestones,"A 'success milestone' is any form of positive interaction between your business and your users. We've talked earlier about the example of a CRM user closing a deal, but milestones come in all shapes and sizes: from someone using your accounting platform to successfully create and submit a tax return, through to a user selling one of their products thanks to your eCommerce software. 

By tracking these milestones, you can engage with your users when they're most grateful to your brand, and help reinforce a positive relationship. You prove that you care about the success of individual users, and you take the time to recognise their success (and if you're not sure what constitutes a success milestone, simply ask your users!).
",Retention,,,Moderate,No
659,Send Physical Gifts to Users,"It's a universal truth that people love free stuff. When you have particularly evangelical fans and especially dedicated users, it makes sense to reward their hard work, and reinforce their helpful behaviour. To do that., it's as simple as sending them something free, personal and awesome.

I've been on the receiving end of a handful of free gifts, and they never cease to make me feel recognised and grateful. You can experiment with:

Branded postcards with space for a handwritten note
Vinyl stickers to decorate laptops/folders/guitars/anything
T-shirts
Specially branded beers","Retention, Referral",,,High,No
660,Manual Outreach to Your First Customers,"Your first ~100 customers are hugely important. They provide the first tentative signs that your product has decent market fit, and their early involvement helps refine the future direction of the business. With that importance in mind, it's a great idea to personally reach out to your first users, and get to know them a little bit better.

This can be as simple as setting up a quick call, or exchanging a few personal emails. Talking about their needs, progress with the product and general thoughts around your business and service can be hugely beneficial, both to the growth of your company and the happiness of your users:

Learn more about the needs of your users, and shape the future development of your product.
Refine and improve your buyer personas.
Create a personal dynamic between your business and your users.","Retention, Referral",,,High,No
661,Follow-Up Every Customer Interaction,"Customer service is a staple part of running a SaaS solution; but that doesn't mean your job should stop after the customer has hung-up the phone. Even with a perfect resolution to their problem, you can still go a step further to delight your customer, by following up every customer interaction you have.

A simple email or in-app message is enough; and by checking-in on your customers, and seeing if their problems are still resolved, you can work wonders for the business-user dynamic.","Retention, Referral",,,Moderate,No
662,Be Proactive With Problems,"In any growing business, problems happen. Servers go down, payments get taken early, and new features go live with bugs and glitches. To help your customers weather the storm of these problems, it's crucial to be proactive whenever an issue appears.

Instead of hiding behind a customer support number, reach out to all of your affected users as soon as a problem appears. Let them know what's happened, how it'll affect them, and most importantly of all, what you're doing to solve it. This way, problems don't have to be disastrous for customer-business relations.
","Retention, Referral",,,Moderate,No
663, Involve Users in Product Development,"The most common reason cited for a customer ceasing to use a product or service isn't that they have a major problem. In 70% of cases they leave due to receiving poor quality of service.

Involving users in product development isn't just a great way to build an exceptional product that your users need, but it also makes them feel more involved. Long term that's only good for business, both in terms of retaining more customers and increasing their average spend.

Tools like UserVoice are great for encouraging customers to contribute to customer development, just make sure you respond to requests and engage with anyone that comments.","Retention, Referral",,,Moderate,No
