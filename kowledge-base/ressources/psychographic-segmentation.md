# Psychographic Segmentation: Complete Marketing Psychology Guide

## Introduction

**Psychographic segmentation is the study and classification of customers according to their attitudes, aspirations, values, and other psychological criteria for marketing purposes.** Unlike demographic segmentation which focuses on observable characteristics, psychographics delves into the psychological drivers behind consumer behavior.

### What is Psychographic Segmentation?

Psychographics examines:
- **Personality traits** and psychological characteristics
- **Values** and belief systems  
- **Opinions** and attitudes
- **Interests** and lifestyle preferences
- **Motivations** and decision-making patterns

### Why Psychographics Matters for Marketing

Since the primary goal of marketing is to persuade people to purchase products or services, psychographics provides the psychological insight needed to:
- **Tailor campaigns** with maximum relevance for each segment
- **Craft messages** that resonate with specific personality types  
- **Optimize conversion rates** through targeted psychological appeals
- **Reduce marketing waste** by focusing on responsive segments

### OCEAN Model for Psychographic Segmentation

Using the **Big Five/OCEAN personality model** for psychographic segmentation provides comprehensive insight into customer psychology across multiple dimensions:

#### Personal Characteristics
- **School performance** and learning preferences
- **Preferred occupations** and career paths
- **Individual characteristics** and behavioral patterns
- **Internal values** and belief systems
- **Lifestyle choices** and daily habits

#### Preferences and Behavior
- **Entertainment preferences** (movies, literature, art, games, music)
- **Product preferences** (cars, technology, brands)
- **Shopping motivation** and decision-making processes
- **Communication style** and language patterns
- **Social media behavior** and platform preferences

#### Marketing Applications
- **Preferred brand personalities** and messaging styles
- **Most effective marketing channels** by personality type
- **Optimal design elements** for websites and campaigns
- **Typography preferences** and visual aesthetics
- **User interface elements** that drive engagement

Enhanced Customer Persona
Understanding the psychological traits that define each market segment provides an efficient way to improve almost every aspect related to your marketing campaigns and strategies. Psychographics segmentation provides an unprecedented way to understand the values, motivation, decision making, needs, desires and behaviour of your potential customers. For example, people that score high in Extroversion are more likely to be interested in sports, while people high in Agreeableness are less likely to be interested in sports.

Address specific needs
Based on the Big Five/OCEAN traits, some personalities prefer novelty while others are stable and predictable; people high in Neuroticism are insecure and cautious while people high in Extroversion are adventurous and confident. Understanding each segment allows you to address specific needs, leading to higher engagement from your potential customers.

Compelling Ads
Not only can you target specific needs, but psychographics provides information on how to phrase your message, what images to use, the colours each segment prefers, what persuasion techniques work best for each segment and even the font they are more likely to appreciate.

Optimize Marketing
There is a strong link between personality and behaviour, reflected in the way people use the internet, social media and smart phones. Understanding how your potential customers behave allows you to use the most efficient channel to reach them, reducing marketing effort and costs, while still providing better results than any general approach.

Adjust Brand Values
In order to better appeal to your preferred psychographic segments your brand can adjust their image, values, commitments and policies. For example, sportswear companies should be perceived as more active and dynamic to address high Extroversion people. Technical/Industry companies, that address mostly Conscientious people should be perceived as stable, calculated, organized and reliable to attract the most favourable segment of customers.

Better Conversion Rates
Targeting specific segment needs, in a preferred way, on their preferred channels, in their preferred manner is most likely to provide the best conversion rates for any marketing campaign.

How to collect psychographic segmentation data?
Customer Interviews: given the possibility, directly asking your current customers what motivates them, how they perceive themselves, your brand and your products can help you better understand the psychographic segments you are already reaching. While the process itself might be tedious and take a long time, it is most likely to provide reliable information.

Online Surveys and Questionnaires: people love to express their opinions, especially if they know that it is going to be heard and taken into account. While you might not reach your actual marketing segments, this approach does provide a general overview of the market and helps you position yourself as a brand.

Focus Groups: gather people from various backgrounds, age groups, biological genders and interests and evaluate how they respond to you, your brand and your products. Keep in mind that focus groups might easily get biased by group thinking.

Marketing Research Companies: you might choose to delegate this task to specialized companies who generally employ multiple channels and methods to gather information and structure it for you.

Adamant Links Analytics: with our proprietary method you can analyse and predict user personality using non-invasive, anonymous site behaviour and usage data. Our product provides real-time analytics for each customer, leading to a real and accurate psychographic segmentation of all the people that visit your site.

Psychographics and Biological Gender
Psychological gender differences have been established and thoroughly studied for more than 40 years. Beginning in 1980s and to the present day, scientists have been able to observe and study consistent and relevant psychological differences between men and women, as a result of the degree of prenatal androgen exposure within normal levels, direct genetic effects and the exposure of the brain to different levels of gender prevalent hormones (oestrogen and testosterone).

Some of these differences are clearly validated across multiple studies, for example the fact that on average, women tend to be more agreeable than men. However, a limited number of psychological aspects that strongly relate to specific, individual experience with caregivers, life experiences, social expectations and pressure, promoted and enforced gender roles and stereotypes, remain specific to each individual and are not taken into account in psychographics.

Taking all of these factors into account, the Big Five/OCEAN personality model is still able to provide reliable, repeatable and explicable results across countries and cultures.

On average women tend to score higher on the Agreeableness and Neuroticism dimensions compared to men. On certain facets of the Extroversion dimension (for example Warmth) and the Openness to Experience dimension (for example Feelings) women also tend to score higher. While there may seem to be a direct link between these personality differences and social roles (for example expecting mothers to be warmer and express their feelings more often), studies have shown that this is not the case.

The finding show that the psychological differences are more clearly defined in more equalitarian countries, compared to smaller differences in low gender equality countries. In other words, countries where gender equality is adopted and applied favour larger differences in personality dimension scoring between men and women.

For a better understanding on how the Big Five gender differences manifest and how they can help marketing and market segmentation we will use specific traits (characterized in 2007 by DeYoung based on the International Personality Item Pool – IPIP) for each personality dimension.

Intellect and Aesthetics facets of Openness to Experience
Before going further, please note that Intellect (as defined by International Personality Item Pool – IPIP) does not refer to intelligence, but ability to learn or human potential. It simply defines the preference for: mastering language, thinking about complex ideas, thinking about oneself, enjoy reading difficult materials, having a vivid imagination. Aesthetics refers to a preference for poetry, art and beauty, getting immersed in music, enjoying nature, being creative, reflecting on things and noticing elements that others might not notice.

Women constantly score higher in Aesthetics, while men score higher in Intellect. In fact, women score higher than men on all facets/traits of the Openness dimension, except for Intellect and Ideas, where men usually score higher. While Intellect is not representative for IQ/Intelligence (for which, gender differences are negligible), it does influence the perception of individuals over their self-estimated intelligence. As a result, men constantly estimate their intelligence to be higher, while women tend to estimate it as being lower than it actually is. Taking it a step further, studies link these biases to the fact that men tend to manifest more hubris while women tend to manifest more humility.

In terms of marketing, strategies targeting hubris refer to challenging the status, practices, self-image or habits of the customer while proposing a better alternative, usually in terms of perceived self-image, especially compared to their competition (thus appealing to hubris). For example, while marketing a newer version of a product, aside from pointing out the increased benefits/upgrades/options you can appeal to its price accessibility, limited availability and, of course, the rare status confered by owning the product (all appealing to hubris). Remember we are referring to Openness to Experience, and if the hubris targeting strategy makes people feel uncomfortable or underappreciated it may lead the opposite effect (of not being open to your product or services). For example, in the aforementioned scenario, criticizing their previous acquisition and then presenting the better alternative would have a negative outcome.

For women, Openness leads to strategies that target uniqueness and individuality. As you probably noticed in most commercials, women are not encouraged to compete with other women, especially in terms of looks and accessories (which would be a hubris related strategy), but they are encouraged to be unique, define their own style, chose a product that makes them feel good, safe and beautiful. The strong points of any campaign targeting Openness in women should be focused on the Aesthetic of the product and the Feeling of owning the product (both being facets of the Openness to Experience).

Industriousness and Orderliness facets of Conscientiousness
According to International Personality Item Pool, Industriousness refers to: the tendency to carry out plans, finish things quickly and tend to always know the next steps. Orderliness refers to: a preference for keeping tings tidy, following a schedule and identify established rules.

Considering these two facets of Conscientiousness, women tend to score higher in Orderliness, while there does not seem to be a significance differences between men and women in terms of Industriousness. However, if men and women have similar scores in orderliness, then men tend to score higher in Industriousness.

In terms of marketing, strategies that target men and women should be similar and based on utilitarian aspects of the purchase. The product itself needs to solve a real issue. For example, shoes need to be comfortable but also look good, so that they fit the lifestyle of a hard-working, business-oriented person. If marketing a tool, software application or piece of machinery, the product needs to increase efficiency by either reducing times, increasing quality or lower prices.

Another important aspect of marketing to Conscientious people is that prices, expenses, taxes, transport and features need to presented clearly and in an orderly fashion as people high in this dimension prefer things to be predictable and want to plan around their purchases (for example, they might think: "I will do this specific action on the specific day the purchase will arrive").

Enthusiasm and Assertiveness facets of Extraversion
The Enthusiasm facet reflects sociability, gregariousness, and experiences of positive emotion, while Assertiveness refers to agency and dominance. On average, women score higher than men in reference to most Extroversion traits of Big Five/OCEAN model, however women consistently score higher in enthusiasm, while men score higher in assertiveness.

In terms of marketing, strategies targeting enthusiasm may relate to social interaction, including social media and the positive emotions generated by the purchase. It is common to see commercials that target women to display at least two women discussing the benefits of a product and how they feel after they have purchased it.

For men, strategies that target assertiveness should be able to convince of the benefit of a purchase, while not challenging their sense of agency and dominance. Being too pushy or too demanding might chase away the highly scoring Assertive men. Being helpful provides better results. For example, “Buy Now” or “Last Chance to Buy” diminish the sense of agency. On the other hand, presenting benefits and giving the possibility to freely choose (free demo, samples, video presentation of various possible options/versions/features) is more likely to convince highly Extrovert customers. Just to make it clear, people who score high in Assertiveness (and to some extent in Extroversion) do not like to be told what to do. Another relevant aspect for targeting highly Assertive people is that they do not have the patience to view large amounts of materials or data and prefer marketing data to be short and to the point.

Both men and women that score high in Extroversion, prefer to view more images of the product before making a decision.

Compassion and Politeness facets of Agreeableness
Studies show that women score higher than men in terms of Agreeableness and the associated facets. This translates into women being more polite, trusting and more socially active, willing to invest in maintaining social groups and relations.

In terms of marketing, social consensus is key for any strategy targeting highly Agreeable people. Scoring, number of views, reviews and number of shares all increase the value of the marketed product. Direct benefits are less important, compared to group (or groups) opinion.

However, high Agreeableness also comes with a set of limitations, as people who score high in this dimension do not respond well to aggressive attitude and campaigns, do not respond well to socially unaware or morally challenging brands, products and ideas. They avoid confrontation and strongly avoid dominant individuals, as they appreciate social groups and human values more.

Another relevant aspect of marketing towards Agreeable people is that they highly appreciate the honesty and straight forwardness. If your ad, copy or message seem disingenuous or shady, Agreeable people will most likely avoid your products.

Volatility and Withdrawal facets of Neuroticism
Volatility refers to the predisposition of quickly changing the mood, getting angry, upset, agitated or stirred up easily. Withdrawal refers to feeling threatened easily, worrying more, getting discouraged and frequently feeling overwhelmed by events.

On average, women score higher in Withdrawal (and all others Neuroticism facets), while men score higher in Volatility. As a result, women tend to have an increased need for security and express more often a feeling of vulnerability, while men tend to manifest anger and hostility more (and easier).

In terms of marketing, women require more reassurance or security. Having warranty information and money back policy clearly stated improves any marketing strategy. For examples, large retailers provide the option to get the ordered clothes delivered to one of their work points where the customer can try the items in a dressing room, after which they pay and keep only those items that they want. This increases the feeling of safety for the purchase by increasing the level of control the person has over it.

In contrast people scoring higher in Volatility rapidly loose interest in your product or service if something is not going as they expect it. Constraints, hidden costs, bad customer service or being too pushy can discourage a Volatile customer from making a purchase. They need to be provided with a simple and safe framework for the purchase; in this framework their purchase cannot be criticised or frowned upon as it is an optimal purchase and they are given sufficient time to make the decision (hastening the process results in a sense of pressure and the implicit avoidance).

Psychographics and Age
With the exception of childhood (when personality takes shape), personality remains mostly constant over a person’s lifetime, with studies showing that as a person gets older, the more pronounced each dimension of the Big Five/OCEAN model gets.

For example, let’s assume that a person scores 40 on the Openness to Experience dimension in their 20’s; by the time they will be 40 years old, the score should have increase to somewhere between 50 and 60. In a similar manner someone scoring 80 in their 20 would most likely score around 90+ when they reach 50 years of age. However, the various traits/facets of each dimension have a different evolution over time, which we will discuss in details in this article.

Between 20 and 30 years old
Both men and women in this age group have a very rapid increase in scoring for the Ideas trait (curiosity, open-mindedness, willingness to consider new ideas) of Openness. In this age group, women tend to have a far greater score and a greater increase compared to men in the Self-Discipline trait of Conscientiousness (the difference remains constant for the other age groups as well). In terms of Activity (facet of Extroversion) women have a greater decrease, compared to men, although, both genders tend to reach the similar values by age 30. Almost all facets of Agreeableness suffer a decrease in scoring in this group age. Finally, for the Neuroticism dimension, while Anxiety (fearful, nervous, tense) facets decreases, the Depression (guilt, hopelessness, sadness, loneliness) facet increases, for both genders.

In terms of marketing, people in this age group are more interested in novelty. This is the period in people’s lives where they are willing to try new things, to adopt new brands, trends and habits. Everything that is hot and trendy catches their eye. Fashion and aesthetics are at their peak and looks play an important role. As representative example, iPhone usage spikes for people in this age group, peaking around age 35.

Between 30 and 40 years old
For almost all facets and dimensions of Big Five this age group presents almost no variance in scoring. This suggests that this period in people's lives is where personality is most stable. Anxiety and Depression facets of Neuroticism start a slow, but clear decrease in scoring for both men and women. Aesthetics for men suffers a decrease in score.

In terms of marketing, men become less interested in Aesthetics, which means that trends, fashion and looks start to count less in terms of preferences and purchase. However, the need for security decreases, leaving place for higher priced purchases and preferences. While fashion is no longer of very high interest, people in this age group have a more active career and as a result they value being well dressed, this being reflected in the purchase of more conservative, but higher quality clothes, shoes and accessories. Public image plays a crucial role in terms of purchasing preferences, and people in this age group tend to be driven more by a hubristic motivation.

Between 40 and 50 years old
This age group continues the trend of low variance in scoring across all facets and dimensions. The exceptions from this trend refer to Self-Discipline (facet of Conscientiousness) and Compliance (facet of Agreeableness) which significantly increase for women in this age group.

This age group is probably the most complicated to target in terms of marketing. They already have established preferences. They have a greater sense of self and their needs and are less likely to change. However, both men and female continue scoring lower in terms of Anxiety, making them prone to even more expensive purchases.

For women, social consensus becomes a great indicator for purchase preferences; keep in mind that social network usage in this group age is reduced, and other, more original and less social network dependent strategies are required to reach women in this age group. For a limited number of people, with the necessary financial situation, this age represents the period of transition from hubristic to hedonistic motivation for purchasing expensive or luxurious products and services.

Between 50 and 60 years old
Self-Discipline (facet of Conscientiousness) and Compliance (facet of Agreeableness) continue to significantly increase for women in this age group. The same is true for Aesthetics (facet of Openness) which also increases significantly for women in this age group. Overall, there is also a significant decrease in terms of Extroversion, for both genders.

In terms of marketing, this age group is represented by fulfilling purchase ambitions, as opposed to buying for personal image as seen for the previous age groups. Most expensive car brands declare the average age of their buying customers as being between 50 and 55 years. Expensive vacation and cruises, luxury brands, and luxury fashion items for women are the preferred purchases for this age group. Quality of service and ease of purchase play important roles, while directly interacting with sales people becomes a less desirable element.

Psychographics and Other Demographic Segments
Geographic Distribution
The personalities most prone to advertising, brand loyalty, purchase loyalty, social media use, positive response to social media ads and tend to see shopping as hedonistic are Extroverts and people Open to Experiences. However, people displaying high score for Extroversion and Openness to Experience can be found primarily in Northern America and Western Europe.

Unfortunately for marketing specialists, these two regions (and also Oceania and Southern Europe) also have the highest scores in Conscientiousness, which have the lowest use of social network, lowest response to digital ads and perceive shopping as mostly utilitarian. To follow the scoring average trend, Northern America and Western Europe are also the highest in neuroticism. The South and South Est Asia score lowest in Agreeableness, while Africa scores lowest in Openness to Experience.

The distribution of personality traits also varies based on countries. For example, Canadians are less likely to be Extroverts and Open to Experience and are more likely to be Agreeable, Conscientious and Neurotic. In contrast, in Switzerland, people tend to be less Agreeable and Conscientious and more likely to be Extroverts, Open to experience and Neurotic.

An interesting observation is that regardless of the distribution of personality traits, neuroticism is moderately high in almost all countries and on all continents. Exceptions can be found in Croatia, Estonia, the Republic of Congo and Finland in which people have lower overall averages in Neuroticism.

The distribution of personalities also varies based on where people live. The closer a person lives compared to the metropolitan areas the less likely they are to be Agreeable and Conscientiousness, while if they live in rural areas, they are more likely to be highly Agreeable. People living in urban areas score higher in Conscientiousness and Openness to experience, while people in rural areas also score lower in these two dimensions.

Job Preferences
Personality traits are corelated to career preferences, specific fields of expertise and academic achievements. While all personalities can excel in attaining academic degrees, people scoring high in Conscientiousness are more likely to obtain a masters or doctorate degrees, while people scoring high in Neuroticism are the least likely to obtain any higher education degrees.

Conscientious people favour organized, planned and structured work and as such they tend to favour technical or engineering careers. People high in Conscientiousness and Extroversion prefer (and excel) in managerial positions. People high in Conscientiousness, but low in Agreeableness, can (and sometimes do) become strict, rigid and punishing teachers and professors.

People Open to Experiences favour jobs that require travel (like pilot, tour guide). Having a low need for security they sometimes become entrepreneurs. Their interests towards the arts and aesthetics make people high in Openness to Experience to follow carriers as writers, musicians or painters.

People that score high in Agreeableness favour jobs in education (teacher, professor), health care (nurse) or that require directly working with people (HR, recruiting, people management). People who score low in Agreeableness, avoid human related careers and prefer decision making positions.

A high score in Extroversion is also related to socially engaging careers like public speaker, coaching, TV presenter and almost anything related to sales or entertainment. People high in Extroversion and Openness to Experience may prefer research/scientific careers or technical fields of activity. They are willing to experiment and invest time to achieve significant results and are more resilient to failure.

Neuroticism is more difficult to define in terms of career preferences. People with higher emotional stability (implicitly low scores in Neuroticism) favour high pressure jobs (counsellor, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, hostage negotiator). When paired with higher score in Conscientiousness, people with high score in Neuroticism tend to become highly competitive managers. Paired with Extroversion, people high in Neuroticism tend to be more creative and pursue artistic careers. People with lower emotional stability (high score in Neuroticism) tend to prefer low responsibility or low engagement careers where the possibility to make a significant mistake is limited or non-existent.

Income
Income market segmentation is extremely relevant for any marketing campaigns, considering as customer buying power (after-tax money) is directly proportional with income; the bigger the income, the bigger the buying power. For example, the average salary of a medical doctor in the USA is $294,000/year (across all specialities; as of 2018). Considering this amount, you can clearly market luxury cars to medical doctors. Construction workers, which earn around $40,000/year would find it difficult to purchase an average luxury car (estimated at around $100,000).

As you might expect from this series of articles, personality is strongly connected with income. People scoring higher in Conscientiousness and Extroversion have a 7% higher income then other people. This difference increases if the person has a postgraduate degree to about 18% higher income. However, Conscientiousness alone, while it is a clear indicator of higher job performance, is not significantly related to higher wages.

It may be difficult to accept that people scoring high at Agreeableness (trust, altruism, sincerity) have lower wages (with approximately 2% to 6%), compared to people with the same education and on similar positions but that score lower on this dimension. The main reason for this decrease is that Agreeable people are less aggressive or decisive when negotiating their salaries or when highlighting their contribution and their results.

People high in Neuroticism, but with a high education suffer no salary penalty as opposed to people with high Neuroticism but with a lower education which earn 6% less.

Finally, people Open to Experience earn about 9% more than other people with the same education and a similar position, but that have higher scores in other dimensions of the Big Five/OCEAN model.

Psychographics and Individual Preferences
Personality plays a big role in our lives, being directly involved in our motivation, decision making, values and preferences. Studies have confirmed that each personality has specific preferences that rarely overlap allowing marketers to make use of these preferences to better understand and address their potential customers.

Having access to individual preferences allows for very specific adjustments to messages, campaigns and ads in a way that they become appealing and relevant to each specific personality profile. For example, if you want to relate to your customers based on car preferences, in a commercial or ad, you would show an SUV to engage Conscientious people, a minivan for Agreeable people and sports car to appeal to people high in Extroversion.

And it’s not just cars! Personality based preferences extend from favoured colours to shopping motivation and consistently preferred behaviours.

Since we are addressing this topic from a marketing point of view, we will start with shopping motivation. People high in Conscientiousness are motivated by the utilitarian aspect of a purchase. They tend to buy things that they believe would solve a problem they are facing. It is unlikely to see a person high in Conscientiousness buy products or services because are trendy, aesthetically pleasing or on sale. On the opposite side, Extroverts and people Open to Experience (to a lower degree) manifest a hedonistic shopping motivation. These are the people that shine at every event. Trendy, fashionable and always in the centre of attention these are the people you see wearing neon green shows or silver ties and taking selfies with the latest smartphone.

Related to shopping motivation, both Conscientious and Extrovert people manifest overconfidence as they are very unlikely to be swayed from their purchase intent. The other three personalities are more likely to adhere to mass behaviour and social consensus when deciding what to buy.

Openness to Experience
People open to experiences favour novelty and aesthetics. They tend to avoid routine, repetitive tasks or indoor activities. They like to travel, explore and satisfy their curiosity. They are more likely to buy online, although compulsive or impulsive behaviour is not in their nature. They are early adopters and trend setters, sometimes peculiar, and they love to take risks. They purchase things that trigger their imagination and respond to ads that provoke intense feelings. It’s also worth mentioning that they are not the greatest fans of conformity or traditionalism.

While they are outgoing, they avoid sporting activities or events and prefer moderate exercise, usually outdoors. Their interest in aesthetics, translates into greater interest for art, poetry and literature but also in a preference towards abstractions, metaphors and more complex concepts.

Conscientiousness
Conscientious people are orderly and achievement oriented. They are hard workers, perfectionists and highly industrious. Distraction as media, fashion or events are of little importance for them as they prefer a sense of accomplishment over sensing pleasure. Concerned with their health they manifest good impulse control, but are less likely to engage in sports or work out.

They are calculated with their time and with their purchases. However, the achievement aspect of their personality sometimes leads to purchases that confirm personal status (the big house on the hills, the convertible and the gold watch, while often a stereotype, correctly describes their behaviour).

Extroversion
Extroverts favour human interaction above everything else. Not only are they friendly and gregarious, but the social component is also associated with being appreciated and standing out. As such, they are the most likely to practice various sports, work out and take better care of the way they look, especially in public.

They frequent bars, restaurants, clubs and events, are always up to speed with the latest trends and news and are willing to spend more on clothes, sportswear and beauty and hygiene products. They prefer energetic and engaging brands.

Agreeableness
Agreeable people focus on family, friends and the needs of the many. They often engage in volunteer work and prefer speeding time with friends and family. They are supportive, involved and like to express optimism. However, they do not like to talk about work, media or sports. Human values take precedence, leading to a utilitarian approach in their activities and purchases.

While they avoid investing in appearance and trends, they are however more prone to adhere to social consensus. They invest in healthcare, comfort and almost anything related to children. Having a family and children are key elements in their lives and they tend to focus their time and efforts in this direction. They prefer family and environment friendly brands and products.

Neuroticism
Neurotics revolve around their excessive need for security and managing negative emotions. They avoid competitions, risks, feeling exposed in public and being in the centre of attention. As such, they avoid public events and activities and are more likely to invest their time in media, television and various game (both electronic and board games). In order to avoid feeling shame, guilt or to avoid being criticized they prefer safe purchases from reliable companies. When under stress or the effect of negative emotions they tend to engage in impulsive or compulsive shopping, putting a greater focus on the price rather then the utility or ease of use of the product. A particularity related to their emotional behaviour is that they tend to express anger in various forms, both in real life and online.

People high in neuroticism are more likely to express their negative thought related to purchases, brands or products; they are also likely to share and comment on posts that express negative emotions. While they are the least likely to work out or enjoy sports, they might invest in clothes, fashion, beauty products and accessories in an effort to avoid feelings of embarrassment or being ridiculed in public.

Psychographics and Internal values
Values define the way people evaluate the outcome of their actions (including the experience of consumption and post-consumption), their thoughts, needs, wishes, desires and objectives. Anything that is aligend with our values, will seem valuable to us, while anything not related to our values will seem irrelevant or even detrimental.

If a product is perceived as bad for the environment then people with Universalism values, might feel guilty after purchase or consumption, leading to a decline in their emotional state related to that product. As a consequence, they might be tempted to avoid that product in the future. If the product image, or brand, is aligned with that person’s internal values they are more likely to appreciate it and seek it out in the future. For example, while it may not be pleasant, try to recall any celebrity scandal and how brands (perfectly aware of the relationship between values and their brand image) have immediately cut all ties to that celebrity in the hopes of preventing the negative association with their brand.

We take into consideration the following values:

Power: being in charge of people and resources and having social power, wealth, authority.
Achievement: seeking socially recognized successes obtained through ambition and competence.
Hedonism: seeking sensual pleasure, fun and enjoying life.
Stimulation: having stimulating experiences; being daring and living an exciting life.
Self-direction: favouring independence of thought and action, creativity, freedom and seeking to satisfy curiosity.
Universalism: promoting the welfare of all people, equality, social justice, protecting the environment.
Benevolence: promoting the welfare of people in the closed social circle, helpfulness, loyalty, honesty, forgivness.
Conformity: values controlling impulses to fulfill others’ expectations; self-discipline, obedience.
Tradition: favouring maintaining traditions; moderation, devotion.
Security: seeking to satisfy safety and security of self, family, and nation; social order, cleanliness.
Values are an integral part of our motivation system. And like with the previously discussed aspects of human existence, values can be correlated to personality dimensions. For example, people who are Open to Experience favour stimulation and universalism, while they avoid traditionalism and conformity. At the opposite pole, Agreeable people (who also favour social consensus) prefer traditional values and conformity, while they oppose any values related to power and influence.

The borders between the motivators are most of the time artificial and one value may flow into the another, leading to different motivational factors. As such, manifesting various combinations of values, leads to different behaviours.

We take into consideration the following values:

Power and Achievement: the need for social superiority and esteem (respect or admiration).
Achievement and Hedonism: self-centred satisfaction, the pursue of achievements as a means of obtaining personal satisfaction or pleasure.
Hedonism and Stimulation: motivation to invest in activities, purchases and objectives with the purpose of feeling arousal.
Stimulation and Self-direction: the internal motivation to learn and master new things.
Self-direction and Universalism: the motivation using personal judgment to obtain comfort with the diversity of existence.
Universalism and Benevolence: the motivation to transcend selfish interests in order to help and enhance others.
Benevolence and Tradition: the motivation to invest in, help or improve the immediate group of the individual.
Benevolence and Conformity: the motivation to manifest normative behaviour in order to grow or improve close relationships.
Conformity and Tradition—the motivation to place one’s interests as secondary, in favour of socially imposed expectations.
Tradition and Security: the motivation to preserve existing social arrangements in order to increase or maintain certainty or the feeling of control.
Conformity and Security: the motivation to protect of the established order of things and harmony in relations.
Security and Power: the motivation to avoid or overcome threats by controlling relationships and resources.
Openness to Experience
People high in Openness to Experience are motivated by self-direction, independent thought and action (choosing, creating, exploring) as well as stimulation, excitement, novelty and challenge in life. Their internal values consist of stimulation, self-direction and universalism while they oppose conformity, tradition and security.

In terms of marketing, people high in Openness are most likely to be early adopters of products. They are the ones ordering that new blend of herb tea that nobody notices and the ones that follow the latest news and trends. However, in order to get their attention campaigns and ads need to target their desire for novelty and stimulation while still leaving them the opportunity to choose for themselves. For example, offering samples and free trials works best for people Open to Experiences. Making them feel constrained or pressured has the opposite effect as it inhibits their sense of self-direction.

Another relevant aspect for marketers is the fact that people Open to Experiences avoid brands or products that are perceived as traditional or too conformist. For example, ads portraying the traditional family or that claim an unchanged recipe for decades do not have a favourable effect.

Conscientiousness
People high in Conscientiousness are motivated by the need for security and stability (society, relationships, self), conformity and restraining from actions that might hurt others, traditions, commitment and cultural and/or religious ideas. Their internal values consist of achievement, conformity, security and tradition, while they oppose hedonism and stimulation.

In terms of marketing, Conscientious people show a great interest in products or purchases that can facilitate the process of achieving their goals and objectives. Ads that portrait the benefits of a product are the most likely to create a favourable impression. However, novelty and unproved solutions conflict with their need for security and conformity. As such, they are reserved to make purchases when it comes to new products or products that are too innovative.

Portraying a product or service as appealing primarily to hubris, hedonism or pleasure seeking makes the product seem mostly useless. For example, most chocolate ads and commercials present the product as "captivating the senses" or "a delight for the sense" which does not address any of the Conscientious related values. As such, they are more likely to respond to ads presenting nutrition values, antioxidant benefits or energy boost as the qualities of chocolate.

Without getting in too many details (since we are going to cover this in other articles), Conscientious people usually delay gratification, plan their purchases and are willing to wait before they pruchase something they want.

Extroversion
Extrovert people are motivated by hedonism, pleasure or physical gratification for oneself, personal achievements, demonstrating competence according to social standards, gaining power, prestige, control and/or dominance over people and resources. Their internal values are: power, hedonism, achievement and stimulation while they oppose tradition and security.

In terms of marketing, Extrovert people are more likely to purchase products that would help them shine in public or that confer a special social status. Luxury brands, gear and sportswear, latest smartphones and the occasional "bling" all address hedonism and stimulation. They respond best to ads showing people wearing or using the product in a social context, or the way other people respond to the presence of the product. For example, car ads in which a person drives around town and people turn their heads to admire the marketed model address an extrovert personal values.

The need for security is sometimes associated with weakness by extroverts and as such they pay little attention to warranties and guarantees. As long as the product is able to provide stimulation other aspects are less relevant. As with people Open to Experiences, being too pushy in your ads and campaigns conflicts with their value of self-direction and might have a negative effect.

Agreeableness
People high in Agreeableness are motivated by benevolence, welfare of their social groups, universalism, appreciation, tolerance and protections of people and nature. Their values are universalism, benevolence, conformity, tradition and oppose power.

In terms of marketing, agreeable people favour brands and products that are presented as healthy, friendly to the environment, inclusive and especially family friendly. Ads and commercials that portray traditional families, children or groups of friends, preferably in nature have the highest impact. Ever wondered why breakfast cereal commercials always show a family or at least the mother and an open window leading to a green, pleasant garden?

Technical descriptions have the least impact on their perception, while social consensus seems to work best. Brands perceived as harmful to the environment, unfair to people (or their employees) or that they have some sort of monopole on the market oppose most of their values and as such are avoided.

Neuroticism
People high in Neuroticism are separated in two motivational factor groups based on the dominant traits of the Big Five dimension. They either are motivated by hedonistic pleasure, physical gratification and personal achievement or by tradition, commitment, customs and cultural or religious ideas. Their values consist of power, stimulation, hedonism and security, while they dislike all other values, but just a little.

In terms of marketing, neurotic people are either interested in how the product will make them feel or if the product and its purchase are safe and socially acceptable. Some people high in Neuroticism favour stress management strategies related to impulsive or compulsive behaviour and are more oriented towards hedonistic values.

The other type of neurotic people, are those that have a great need of security and external guidance and as such they prefer traditional values and working towards socially acceptable achievements.

As such, in order to reach Neurotic people, strategies used for Extroverts or Conscientious people are most likely to work.

Shopping motivation
Shopping motivation defines what makes people want to buy your products or services. In terms of motivation, shopping is either hedonistic (referring to the way the purchase and the process of acquisition makes us feel) and utilitarian (referring to paying a fair amount for solving a known, specific problem).

Hedonic Shopping Value
Hedonic motivation (as define by Wikipedia) refers to the influence of a person's pleasure and pain receptors on their willingness to move towards a goal or away from a threat. This is linked to the classic motivational principle that people approach pleasure and avoid pain, and is gained from acting on certain behaviours that resulted from aesthetic and emotional feelings such as: love, hate, fear, joy, etc. According to the hedonic principle, our emotional experience can be thought of as a gauge that ranges from bad to good and our primary motivation is to keep the needle on the gauge as close to good as possible.

Hedonic consumption is defined as "those facets of consumer behaviour that relate to the multisensory, fantasy and emotive aspects of one’s experience with products." Basically, these values are unstructured, mentally, affective and experience-based stimuli driven, pleasant and fun. People with higher hedonic values cannot be satisfied with utilitarian or functional aspects of buying behaviours but enjoyable and pleasurable aspects of them and they regard emotional and psychological values of the shopping experience. Hedonic values are assumed to be associated with gratification through fun, fantasy, playfulness and enjoyment. Hedonic value derived from the shopping experience reflects the emotional or psychological worth of the purchase. Sources of hedonic value could include the joy and/or the excitement of shopping, or the escape from everyday activities that is provided by the experience.

Hedonic goods may also refer to luxury goods, which are seen as desirable objects that allow the consumer to feel pleasure, fun, and enjoyment from buying the product, both in terms of personal achievement (of being able to afford that product) or in terms of social recognition and self-representation in social groups. Because of this, the consumer is generally willing to spend more on luxury hedonic items because they can rationalize that these items are more enjoyable, and won't be purchased very frequently, which allows the buyer to be less price sensitive towards these items. Hedonic goods could constitute anything from pedicures to art to furniture to new power tools to fine chocolate; basically, anything that a consumer enjoys on less than a regular basis.

Guilt also has a tendency to be associated with hedonic purchases. This is due to these items being bought for means that are associated with pleasure and excess, not items that are necessary for daily life and are therefore not as easy to justify buying as utilitarian items. Increasing the frequency of hedonic shopping leads to a decrease in the enjoyment and stimulation of the purchase. This behaviour leads to an increase in the need to buy more expensive, diverse or more uncommon goods and services in order to reach the higher level of excitement of novelty. It is less common for people that usually manifest hedonic motivation to switch their shopping motivation to utilitarian.

In terms of marketing, people Open to Experience are likely to manifest hedonic motivation if the product has a higher degree of aesthetics and novelty or a unique design. They usually describe such products as "something they need to have". As such, they respond to campaigns that focus on novelty and originality and that have an explicit call to action (for example: "Don’t miss out!" or "Try it now!"). People high in Extroversion manifest hedonic motivation for purchases that reflect they desired social status. They are more likely to purchase luxury brands that are very well known as they are perceived to ensure the extrovert will be in the centre of attention. They do not see the benefits of purchasing a luxurious, expensive but unknown brand which would not get any social recognition and cannot reflect their desired social status. Neurotic people are likely to manifest hedonic motivation, when the Volatility and Depression traits of the personality dimension are stronger. Hedonic motivation serves as a mechanism to reduce stress and negative emotional states by immediate gratification and the excitement of the purchase. They usually avoid luxury brands as they fear judgement from others for their expensive purchases, unless they are achievement driven, in which case they act as Extroverts in report to luxury brands.

Utilitarian Shopping Values
Utilitarian motivation (as define by Wikipedia) refers to the decision to purchase something that serves a specific purpose, that directly solves a problem or satisfies a need. It also incorporates the concepts of price, value, durability and reusability and equity.

Utilitarian value reflects shopping with a work mentality. Consumers seek utilitarian value in a task-oriented, rational manner.

Utilitarian motivation does not refer to the purchase of utility goods, which are items that are purchased frequently and are a regular part of the consumer's life, which allows the consumer to be more price sensitive towards these goods because they are purchased and used frequently (for example: cleaning fluid, laundry detergent, hygiene products, or other items that consumers use regularly).

Utilitarian consumer behaviour has been described as task related and rational. As a result, the utilitarian perspective stresses functional and product-centric thinking. Consumption is understood as a mean to accomplish some predefined end. This does not exclude the pleasure of satisfaction of the purchase or brand preferences, but these things are always secondary to the equity of the purchase. For example, people might choose a well-known brand for their consistent high-quality products even if the price is higher than other products of the same type produced by other less reliable perceived companies but only if the value of the purchase is justified. As such, utilitarian motivation is often associated with thorough investigation of the specifications, requirements and technical reviews of the product while less little importance is placed on the aesthetics or associated feelings.

It is common for people that manifest utilitarian motivation to plan their purchases in order to have better control on their finances and spending, making sure that they actually need the product and not just want it. It is common (especially for low price purchases) that people who usually manifest utilitarian shopping motivation to switch to hedonic motivation, for self-indulgence purchases.

In terms of marketing Conscientious people tend to manifest the highest degree of utilitarian motivation. They tend to keep a well-organized household, plan their purchases and even plan around their purchases in order to maximize their effectiveness. People high in Conscientiousness focus on how well a product or service can solve a specific problem and if the value that is offered has a fair price. They usually prefer brands they are very familiar with and tend to return to those brands if they prove to be consistent in their product quality and services. When faced with lower value than expected (for products or services) they start to avoid that specific brands and tend to find it very difficult to trust that brand again. If they are not familiar with a brand and product they try to learn about the product, especially from highly authoritative sources (scientific reviews, technical reviews, major trusted publications and so on).

Agreeable people are also more likely to be utilitarian in their shopping. They value fairness of the purchase and quality of service above other factors and also tend to show the same preference for familiar brands. A major difference between Agreeable people and Conscientious people is the fact that highly agreeable people are less interested in technical aspects and are more likely to value social opinion, family preferences, environmental impact, the perceived brand personality and other less specific criteria when evaluating a purchase.

Impulsive Buying
Impulsive buying has been defined as the spontaneous or sudden desire to buy something, and when compared to more contemplative approaches to decision-making, it considered emotional, reactive, and "prone to occur with diminished regard" for the consequences. Impulse buying occurs when a consumer experiences a sudden, often powerful and persistent urge to buy something immediately.

Impulse buying generates over $4 billion in annual sales volume in the United States. With the growth of e-commerce and television shopping channels, consumers have easy access to impulse purchasing opportunities.

Impulse buying is often described as a mechanism to escape higher levels of stress or emotionally uncomfortable situations as it allows the person to rapidly switch to a positive stated given by the joy and satisfaction of the purchase. Recent research on impulse buying behaviour indicates that individual consumers did not view their specific purchases as wrong and indeed retrospectively reported a favourable evaluation of their behaviour. This is because of the perceived positive outcome of this behaviour.

In terms of personality, people Open to Experience and Neurotics are more likely to manifest this behaviour as they prefer to focus on positive stimuli and they tend to favour positive experiences which lead to immediate or quick gratification.

In some rare cases, Extroverts are also prone to impulsive buying, when the specific purchase is meant to represent their desired social status and they perceive the purchase as a bargain or a good deal.
