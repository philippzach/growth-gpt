# OCEAN Personality Model: Marketing Psychology Guide

## Introduction

**The Big Five personality traits, also known as the OCEAN model, is the most widely used framework for understanding human personality in psychology and marketing.** This taxonomy describes individuals based on five core dimensions that influence behavior, preferences, and decision-making patterns.

### What is the OCEAN Model?

**OCEAN** is an acronym representing the five personality dimensions:

- **O**Openness to Experience
- **C**Conscientiousness
- **E**Extroversion
- **A**Agreeableness
- **N**Neuroticism

### Why OCEAN Matters for Marketers

Every individual manifests each of the five dimensions to varying degrees, creating unique personality profiles that influence:

- **Purchasing behavior** and decision-making processes
- **Channel preferences** and media consumption habits
- **Message reception** and persuasion susceptibility
- **Brand loyalty** and relationship patterns
- **Online behavior** and social media engagement

### Key Applications in Marketing

The OCEAN model enables marketers to:

- **Segment customers** based on psychological profiles
- **Personalize messaging** for different personality types
- **Optimize channel selection** based on trait preferences
- **Improve conversion rates** through targeted approaches
- **Enhance customer experience** via personality-matched interactions

## 1. Openness to Experience

This trait features dominant characteristics such as imagination, insight and novelty. People who are high in this trait also tend to have a broad range of interests, enjoy arts, music and poetry. They are curious about the world and other people, they are eager to learn new things and enjoy new experiences.

People who are high in this trait tend to be more adventurous and creative; they also experience deeper and more differentiated emotional states. People low in this trait are often much more traditional and may struggle with abstract thinking.

Defining Traits:

Exploration
New Things
New Experiences
Rich Imagination
Creative
Complexity
Variety
Insight
Brave (with a low need for security)
Enjoy Arts or Artistic Activities
Creative Hobbies
Learner
Peaceful
Universal Values
Moderate Impulsivity
In terms of marketing, openness to experience characterizes individuals who are willing to consider different points of view and opinions. As such, they are more likely to try to find the newest and most valuable offers, not being satisfied with routine. People high in openness to experience are also more likely to engage in online searches, browsing behavior and online purchases. The openness to experience dimension is positively correlated with both utilitarian and hedonistic motivation for shopping.

CONSCIENTIOUSNESS
The features of this dimension include high levels of thoughtfulness, good impulse control, and goal-directed behaviours. Highly conscientious people tend to be organized and mindful of details. They plan ahead, think about how their behaviour affects others, and are mindful of deadlines.

Defining Traits:

Consistent
Persistent
Predictable
Control (with a high need for security)
Reliability
Planning
Resourceful
Hard Working
Efficient
Organisation
Perfectionism
Ordered
Discipline
In terms of marketing, conscientiousness does not have a significant positive effect on online buying, a possible explanation being the need to avoid the perceived risks of online purchases. Shopping motivation is highly utilitarian and their activity on social media is limited.

EXTROVERSION
Extroversion (or extraversion) is characterized by excitability, sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness, and high amounts of emotional expressiveness. People who are high in extroversion are outgoing and tend to gain energy in social situations. Being around other people helps them feel energized and excited.

People who are low in extroversion (or introverted) tend to be more reserved and have less energy to manifest in social settings. Social events can feel draining and introverts often require a period of solitude and quiet in order to "recharge".

Defining Traits:

Sociable
Assertive
Outgoing
Talkative
Fun Loving
Social Confidence
Friendliness
Non-conformist
Pleasure Seeking
Overconfident (with a very low need for security)
Optimistic
Energetic
In terms of marketing, extrovert people have a dominant behaviour of being in search of sensations. Extroversion makes individuals more receptive to change, to new things and ideas and makes them want social recognition, power and a certain status. Extroverts seek a high level of socialization, share their experiences with others and in the buying process they are willing to follow the suggestions of others. There is a positive relationship between extroversion and hedonistic motivation. Also, out of the Big Five dimensions, extroverts are the most active on social media and have a high use of smartphones.

AGREEABLENESS
This personality dimension includes attributes such as trust, altruism, kindness, affection, and other pro-social behaviours. People who are high in agreeableness tend to be more cooperative while those low in this trait tend to be more competitive and sometimes even manipulative.

Defining Traits:

Altruist
Trusting
Humble
Patience
Helpful
Sensitive
Moderate
Polite
Tradition
Conformity
Cooperation
Interest in Others
Empathy
Although potential customers that have agreeableness as a predominant personality dimension are more easily influenced by the aesthetics of websites and find pleasure in interacting with other online shoppers, they process information and seek alternatives when buying online, counting more on the utilitarian value.

NEUROTICISM
Neuroticism is a trait characterized by sadness, moodiness, and emotional instability. Individuals who are high in this trait tend to experience mood swings, anxiety, irritability, and sadness. Those low in this trait tend to be more stable and emotionally resilient.

Defining Traits:

Pessimism
Moody
Fear
Anxiety
Timid
Insecure (very high need for security)
Unstable
Sensitive
External Locus of Control
Looks for Guidance
External Decision Making
Anger
Frustration
Lack of Self-Control
High Impulsivity
Agitated
Neuroticism is defined as the disruption in the emotional stability through negatively charged emotional states. People with neurotic personality are anxious, isolated and unsociable and avoid situations in which they must take control. There is a negative relationship between computer use and neuroticism. The more neurotic a person is, the harder it is to control emotions and refrain from buying a whim .

In the decision making process of a purchase, neurotics will evaluate whether the purchase that they are about to make will attract the attention of others. Moreover, they will try to reduce negative cognitive reactions for consumption by buying products at low prices and by comparing prices of different vendors. As such, the more neurotic the buyerâ€™s personality is, the more prone the person will be to an utilitarian shopping motivation.

Neuroticism, openness and agreeableness have a small but significant influence on the willingness to shop online. There is a significant and positive relationship between openness to experience and online shopping frequency. Individuals in search of sensations and those who are authoritarian are more likely to make purchases online. The tendency to trust in the intentions and motivations of others has a significant influence on online purchase frequency.
