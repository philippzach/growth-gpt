All presented in a manner that anyone can comprehend.

## 01 Defining Growth Hacking

### Buzzword or Breakthrough?

Digital marketing is no stranger to trendy buzzwords spreading through the airwaves like wildfire. So what does that mean for growth hacking? Is it another fancy term reaping its 15-minutes of fame, or is it something more? Let's find out.

### What is Growth Hacking?

To answer this, we'll quote **Sean Ellis**, former marketer at Dropbox and the person responsible for coining the term "Growth Hacker":

> "In its purest form, growth hacking refers to a set of strategies that scale the acquisition and retention of a company's user or customer base. At its core, growth hacking was designed to help startups achieve massive growth using relatively low budgets."

Sean goes on to define a growth hacker as **"a person whose true one metric that matters is growth."**

In essence, what Sean's referring to is a **mindset**. Growth hacking uses principles, strategies, and processes to enable growth, but it's much more than a rigid marketing method.

Growth hacking is the embodiment of a person's desire to accelerate growth through:

- **Creativity** in finding unconventional solutions
- **Rapid experimentation** to test ideas quickly
- **Iteration** based on data and results

**Growth hacking is where boldness collides with bravery, driven by data.**

### Why Growth Hacking Matters

Research shows that **56% of startup failures** are due to marketing issues, but primarily, it's due to having a **lack of product-market fit** (we'll get into this later).

In short, companies are not correctly identifying:

- The right market
- The right product
- Or both

**Traditional marketing methods** are stable and proven, but in today's ultra-competitive landscape, they can struggle to address unique business challenges. Relying solely on them can cause problems.

**Growth hacking provides a viable alternative**, enabling businesses to:

- **Pivot sharply** when needed
- **Adapt** to shifting trends
- **Discover** untapped opportunities for growth

## 02 Growth Hacking vs Digital Marketing

### What's the Difference?

Growth hacking and digital marketing are often used interchangeably, which leads to confusion for newcomers. However, there are key differences in how each discipline approaches marketing. Let's compare.

### Digital Marketing & Digital Marketers

**Digital marketing** focuses on lead generation and increasing conversions using digital channels and tactics. Digital marketers use various methods to attract, engage and convert customers at different stages of the marketing funnel.

#### The Marketing Funnel

**Top of the Funnel** (Lead Generation Phase)

- Marketing attracts potential customers and increases brand awareness
- **Awareness** & Problem Recognition
- **Interest** & Information Search

**Middle of the Funnel** (Nurturing Phase)

- Marketing works alongside sales team
- Provide valuable information to help customer decisions
- **Consideration** & Evaluation
- **Intent** & Commitment

**Bottom of the Funnel** (Conversion & Retention)

- Emphasis on great customer service
- Retain customers for life and convert to raving fans
- **Conversion** & Purchase
- **Loyalty** & Advocacy

#### Digital Marketing Characteristics

- **Longer project cycles** and campaigns
- **Healthy advertising budgets** to drive results
- **Proven, stable methods** with predictable outcomes

#### Digital Marketing Methods

**Social Media Marketing**

- Creating content and promotions on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube

**SEO Marketing**

- On-page and off-page SEO including creating and optimizing content for search engine rankings

**PPC Marketing**

- Creating pay-per-click advertisements to achieve marketing goals

**Email Marketing**

- Sending emails to subscriber lists that nurture leads, inform customers, or promote products and services

**Content Marketing**

- Creating informative, educational, and entertaining content to build awareness, generate leads and establish authority in a niche

What’s the Difference?
Growth Hacking & Growth Hackers
So if a digital marketer is concerned with attracting, engaging, and converting customers, it would
be fair to say that a growth hacker focuses on the same thing.
But instead of optimising one stage of the funnel, they look to expedite growth at every stage of
the customer journey.
Regardless of the department, a growth hacker seeks to grow the business. Heavily reliant on data,
growth hackers tend to be tech-savvy people that aim to optimise conversions and use A/B (split)
testing to find what works best.
Some examples of departments for growth hacking include:
Marketing
The creation and promotion of content are used to attract, engage and retain customers. This
includes:
➔ Blogs
➔ Whitepapers or e-books
➔ Visual and audio content
Product Development
The process of taking a product from concept all the way through to marketing and sale. Growth
hackers run experiments at different stages of development to help refocus efforts on customer
retention and engagement. Growth hackers use these sorts of tools:
➔ Chatbots
➔ Gamification
➔ SEO
Engineering
The process of creating, testing and managing a product’s development.
A growth hacker might look at the various stages of development and run experiments to speed
the process up. What they’re looking for here, is the “product market fit.” A company

## 03 Growth Hacking Process

From Idea to Execution
Now we get into the heart of growth hacking - the process that transforms visionary concepts into
tangible, scalable growth. In this chapter we’ll guide you through a systematic and results-driven
approach that growth hackers use to identify opportunities, design experiments, and drive rapid
expansion.
Let’s not waste any time!
Find Product-Market Fit
Even great ideas can fall flat. You might have an excellent product, an eager fanbase, and a slew of
channels primed for promotion. But if you haven’t done your due diligence and established whether
it’s the right product for the right market, it’ll likely fail anyway.
How do you find product-market fit? In reality, this looks different for every business. The goal of a
SaaS company won’t be the same as a sportswear brand. But there are some steps you can follow
in the right direction:
➔ Define Your Target Audience & Buyer Personas
Conduct market research that tells you who your customers are, how your product serves them,
and gather enough information to create a buyer persona. Check the video below for more.
How To Find Out Exactly What Your Customers Want (4 Market Research Tips)
➔ Learn Your Customer’s Needs, Intimately
Now it’s time to go a step further. Conduct exploratory research methods such as interviews,
surveys, questionnaires and more to dig deeper into your customers’ needs and challenges,
characteristics, feature priorities, perceptions and perspectives.
➔ Define Your Value Proposition
This is your unique selling point that differentiates you from your competitors. It’s the reason
people will choose you over them.
To determine what that is, ask these questions:
● What are your customer’s biggest gripes?
● What features does your product offer to solve this?
● Why is your solution better/different to a competitor?
● What elements of your brand, company, ethics, and values make you stand out?

➔ Build your Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Your MVP is a version of your product featuring the most basic and essential functionalities. Doing
this helps you to find out what features resonate with customers and speeds up the development
process.
➔ Test Your MVP with Real Customers
With your prototype available, it’s time to test it with a limited audience batch. Gather feedback
through surveys, interviews, and analytics tools to measure which elements of your product satisfy
the customer, and which ones need revising.
➔ Iterate and Improve
Take all of the insights and feedback gathered from previous steps and put them into practice.
Make adjustments and tweaks, collaborate with other departments, then retest your MVP until you
reach product-market fit!
How Do You Know When You’ve Reached Product-Market Fit?
There are two popular methods to determining product-market fit:
➔ Sean Ellis’ Very Disappointed Method: This involves surveying your users, asking how they’d
feel if your product ceased, and segmenting their responses. If 40% or more of your users
would be “very disappointed” then you’ve reached the threshold for product-market fit.
➔ Brain Balfour’s Trifecta Approach: You assess whether your product has some form of
strong organic top line growth, has good retention, and your users are using it correctly. If
you can answer yes to all three - you have product-market fit!
3 Prerequisites for Implementing Growth Hacking
➔ Business Model Canvas - to map out the details of your business.
➔ Value Proposition Canvas - to identify and base decisions around customer needs.
➔ One Metric That Matters (OMTM) - to prioritise the most important stage of your customer’s
journey.

Implement the G.R.O.W.S. Process
In 2016, we developed a 5-step loop for growth hackers to run continuous experiments. Since its
inception, the G.R.O.W.S. process has become an industry-leading methodology.
It consists of these 5 stages:

1. Gather Ideas (Business Intelligence, User Interviews, Analytics, Usability Test)
2. Rank Ideas (Prioritization, Framework, B.R.A.S.S., P.I.E, I.C.E.)
3. Outline Experiments (Minimum Viable Experiment, Time Box, Qualitative REsults)
4. Work, Work, Work (Cross Skilled Teams, Weekly Sprints, Working Agile)
5. Study Data (Hard and Soft Data, Learning, Systemize)

Now let’s break each step down into more detail.

1. Gather Ideas
   Assuming you’ve completed the prerequisite steps, you should have an understanding of the
   biggest problem your customers face. Also known as the One Metric That Matters (OMTM). With
   this knowledge, you can start gathering ideas for possible solutions.
   Here are some tips for your brainstorming phase:
   ➔ Use heatmap tools to understand how users interact with your website
   ➔ Use competitor analysis to measure industry standards
   ➔ Involve all the departments and individuals for a wider perspective
   ➔ Get live feedback from usability tests
   What you’re aiming for is to gather a large stock of ideas. These will act as your backlog for future
   iterations as you loop back to this step.
2. Rank Ideas
   This step is about prioritising your ideas. Growth hackers don’t typically have access to large
   budgets to test ideas, so you need weigh up which solutions will be most beneficial to your
   customers.
   Don’t worry, you won’t be relying on intuition, there are two frameworks you can use to rank ideas:
   ➔ B.R.A.S.S. Framework: Blink, Relevance, Availability, Scalability and Score (BRASS) helps
   determine which acquisition channels to test first.
   -Blink (Gut Feeling)
   -Relevance (Product/Channel Fit)
   -Availability (Ease + Cost)
   -Scalability (Does it scale)
   = Score (ist it worth persuing?)
   ➔ P.I.E. or I.C.E. Frameworks: Which stand for Potential, Importance and Ease (PIE) and
   Impact, Confidence and Effort (PIE). These frameworks are used for experiments
   concerning retention, referral and conversion optimization.

The ideas with the highest scores shoot to the top of your list, these will be the experiments you
run first. Bear in mind, that depending on your specific business, some metrics will be important
than others, so assess ideas accordingly.

3. Outline Experiments
   Growth hackers are masters of efficiency, which is why outlining your experiments is a must. It will
   save time, effort and resources in the long run.
   After you’ve decided which experiments to run, consider these factors in your planning process:
   ➔ Length of the experiment: Think about the optimum duration to yield the best results.
   Consider the length of time it takes to produce certain metrics, for example, traffic stats,
   click-through rates, and page visits, will generally work on 30-day cycles.
   ➔ Check your resources: Do you have the right tools and equipment to run the experiment?
   Invest in necessary tools before you start to avoid disruptions and inaccuracies.
   ➔ Who’s involved?: Organise which departments and members will be collaborating on the
   experiment, this will help speed things up and avoid delays.
   ➔ Track the data: Growth experiments are fast and frequent, be sure to measure the results
   for KPIs and to inform both your growth teams and stakeholders.
   ➔ Launch date: Have a firm start time for your experiment, again, speed is everything with
   growth hacking so don’t let planning drag on. Get up and running ASAP.
4. Work, Work, Work
   Now you can finally run the experiments. Most growth hackers utilise Agile Methodology here with
   “sprints”. These are shorter, incremental cycles to test ideas rapidly. We recommend using Scrum
   Boards to help to keep track of backlogs, who’s working on what, and what still needs doing. Keep
   communication flowing between teams too, this also ensures you stay on track.
5. Study Data
   This is arguably the most important step of the entire process. Studying the data is what tells you if
   an experiment has succeeded or failed.
   Keep in mind though, failure is the currency of growth hacking. It’ll happen often, and it should. In
   any case, make sure to interpret your results into visual data like tables, charts and dashboards
   that can be presented to team members and stakeholders. If your data reveals new insights, add
   these ideas to your existing backlog for future experiments.
   Congratulations! You’ve completed your first growth hacking experiment. So what’s next? You
   guessed it, heading back to the start of the loop and going again!

## 04 Growth Hacking Examples

Real-World Growth Hacking Examples
They might be household names now, but these top-flight companies weren’t always the shining
examples of success we know them as today.
To get their fledgling businesses of the ground, each of them implemented growth hacking tactics
for rapid growth.
Here are some notable examples:
Airbnb
Challenge: Struggling to gain traction in a crowded
travel market.
Solution: Leveraging Craigslist, a popular classified
listings website. Airbnb allowed users to post their
listings simultaneously on Craigslist, automatically
populating both platforms. This increased visibility and
tapped into a massiver user base.
Results: The growth hack led to a significant surge in
user acquisition and exponential growth.
Dropbox
Challenge: Trying to stand out in a a hyper-competitive
cloud storage market.
Solution: Implement a genius referral scheme whereby
users gain free, additional storage with every referral.
Results: The simple, yet effective scheme led to a 60%
increase in signups. Dropbox’s users became brand
advocates, driving new acquisitions while promoting
engagement among existing users.
Real-World Growth Hacking Stories
Hotmail (Outlook)
Challenge: Expand the user base for its free email
service.
Solution: Hotmail added a simple and unobtrusive
message at the footer of every email: “Get your private,
free email at Hotmail.com.”
Result: This viral growth hack turned millions of users
into unwitting brand ambassadors. As recipients saw the
message, their curiosity led them to sign up and within a
year, the user base grew to 12 million users. ````````````
Tinder
Challenge: Quickly grow the user base amongst a
crowded dating app market.
Solution: Tinder created a two-sided incentive. Users
had a limited amount of interactions per day, but could
increase this limit by inviting friends to sign up.
Result: The approach encouraged users to refer friends
to the platform, driving rapid acquisition through a sense
of exclusivity and FOMO. The user base grew rapidly and
is now a dominant player in the dating app arena.
LinkedIn
Challenge: Trying to build a robust networking platform by
attracting and engaging new users.
Solution: LinkedIn introduced the “People You May Know”
feature, which utilised a user’s existing connection to
suggest new ones.
Result: This feature leveraged the user’s social graphs,
tapping into their professional relationships to
recommend relevant connections. It significantly
increased user engagement and user connections on the
platform, and remains a main driver of LinkedIn’s growth.
