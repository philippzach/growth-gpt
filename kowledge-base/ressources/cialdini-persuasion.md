# Cialdini's 6 Principles of Persuasion

## Introduction

**Persuasion is one of the foundational elements of effective marketing and advertising.** While quantitative approaches (focusing on views, clicks, and visitors) can achieve results, they often come with a direct correlation to costs - the more you spend, the more exposure you get.

**Persuasion offers a different path:** It helps increase click-through and conversion rates within your existing audience, transforming your approach from quantitative to qualitative. The more persuasive your message, the more engagement you generate at the same cost.

### Why Cialdini's Principles Matter

While countless persuasion techniques exist across different sources and authors, **six main principles** have been extensively studied, documented, and proven effective in marketing and advertising. These are known as **"Cialdini's Persuasion Techniques"**, named after psychologist Robert Cialdini.

### The 6 Core Principles

1. **Authority** - People follow credible, knowledgeable experts
2. **Commitment/Consistency** - People align with their previous commitments  
3. **Consensus/Social Proof** - People follow the actions of others
4. **Liking** - People say yes to people they like
5. **Reciprocity** - People return favors
6. **Scarcity** - People value what's rare or limited

### How This Guide Works

Each principle includes:
- **Definition** and psychological explanation
- **Implementation methods** with real examples
- **Personality type analysis** showing who responds best
- **Practical applications** for marketing and advertising

## 1. Authority

### What It Is

**People are more likely to listen to and be influenced by those in positions of authority or power.** Job titles (e.g., medical doctor), uniforms, or specialized gear create the perception of authority, making people more likely to accept recommendations from these sources.

### Why It Works

Authority addresses customers on two psychological fronts:

1. **Knowledge Gap:** Most people lack expertise in multiple fields, so they cannot form strong opinions about product quality or value. Expert recommendations provide certainty and security.

2. **Accountability Transfer:** Authority figures take responsibility for the recommendation, alleviating purchase pressure from the customer.

### Implementation Methods

#### Method 1: Direct Expert Credentials
**Show proof that your expert is legitimate and relevant:**
- Display professional titles under expert names
- Include brief narration of credentials in video ads  
- Showcase diplomas, certifications, and achievements
- Highlight years of experience or specializations

**Examples:**
- Health product commercials featuring doctors with "MD" credentials
- Toothpaste ads with "Recommended by 9 out of 10 dentists"

#### Method 2: Third-Party Credibility
**Defer credibility to trusted organizations:**
- Display logos of successful clients or partners
- Show awards and recognitions the product has won
- Feature trusted media mentions and coverage
- Highlight industry certifications or badges

**Examples:**
- "Trusted by Fortune 500 companies like..."
- "Winner of the 2024 Innovation Award"
- "Featured in TechCrunch, Forbes, and Wired"

#### Method 3: Statistical Authority
**Use numbers to show expert consensus:**
- "4 out of 5 specialists recommend..."
- "Used by 95% of industry professionals"
- "Trusted by over 10,000 experts worldwide"

**Note:** Use specific numbers rather than percentages, as they're less likely to be misinterpreted.

#### Method 4: Celebrity/Influencer Authority
**Leverage famous personalities for credibility:**
- Celebrity endorsements for mass-market products
- Industry influencers for specialized products
- Thought leaders for B2B services

**Example:** eToro using Alec Baldwin for financial services ads - his authority gave more weight than unknown business analysts could provide.

> **Important:** Authority is the core technique behind **Influencer Marketing**

### Personality Type Responses

#### ‚úÖ Most Responsive

**High Agreeableness**
- Strong tendency to be compliant and defer to others
- Rarely oppose authority viewpoints
- Empathetic and accepting of "trusted" authorities
- Highly trusting but become avoidant if misled

**High Openness to Experience**  
- Open to new ideas from reliable sources
- Don't like being told what to do directly
- More willing to explore based on authority recommendations
- Respond best to brand evangelists and thought leaders

#### ‚ùå Less Responsive

**High Conscientiousness**
- Skeptical by nature
- Only trust authority in technical/scientific fields
- Avoid non-scientific authorities
- Rarely convinced by celebrities

**High Neuroticism**
- Similar to Conscientious types
- Need demonstrable expertise
- Prefer scientific over celebrity authority
- Focus on credible, technical credentials

## 2. Commitment/Consistency

### What It Is

**People are more likely to do something if they commit to it verbally or in written form.** Humans have a deep psychological need to be seen as consistent. Once we've publicly committed to something, we're much more likely to follow through on that commitment.

### Why It Works

From a psychological perspective, people align their commitments with their **self-image**. Being inconsistent with previous commitments creates cognitive dissonance, which people naturally want to avoid.

### Implementation Methods

#### Method 1: Progressive Commitment (Foot-in-the-Door)
**Start with small, safe commitments and gradually increase the ask:**

1. **Initial Small Commitment:** Get customers to agree to something low-risk and preferably free
2. **Public Commitment:** Make the commitment visible to others (increases accountability)  
3. **Follow-up Offer:** Use the initial commitment to request larger commitments

**Examples:**
- Free newsletter signup ‚Üí Premium content ‚Üí Paid course
- Webinar attendance ‚Üí Product demo ‚Üí Purchase
- Social media follow ‚Üí Email list ‚Üí Product purchase

**Platforms for Public Commitments:**
- Social networks (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter)
- Public forums and blogs
- Your website's community features
- Event RSVPs and registrations

#### Method 2: Brand Familiarity & Consistency
**Leverage the preference for familiar brands:**
- **Consistent exposure** builds familiarity
- **Familiar brands** are chosen over unknown ones
- **Product updates** benefit from existing customer loyalty
- **Repeat purchases** become automatic habits

**Examples:**
- Software version upgrades (consistency with current tools)
- Brand extensions (new products from trusted brands)
- Subscription renewals (maintaining current service)

### Key Success Factors

‚úÖ **Commitment must be voluntary** - Forced commitments backfire
‚úÖ **Start small** - Begin with low-risk, easy commitments  
‚úÖ **Make it public** - Public commitments have higher follow-through rates
‚úÖ **Build gradually** - Use small commitments to enable larger ones

### Personality Type Responses

#### ‚úÖ Most Responsive

**High Conscientiousness**
- Defined by consistency and traditionalism
- High need for stability and predictability
- Prefer familiar experiences over unknown ones
- Strong follow-through on commitments

**High Agreeableness**
- Value consistency in relationships and decisions
- Prefer stability over uncertainty
- Likely to honor commitments made to others
- Respond well to familiar brands and processes

#### ‚ùå Less Responsive

**High Openness to Experience**
- Personality traits include "trying new things" and "variety"
- Less likely to maintain commitment to specific brands
- Prefer exploration over consistency
- May abandon commitments for new experiences

#### üîÑ Special Cases

**Openness, Extroversion, Neuroticism** respond positively to consistency when:
- **Product upgrades** offer new, improved, or exciting features
- **Daily shopping** involves automatic, habitual decisions
- **Food and beverages** where routine purchases dominate
- **Technology updates** that enhance current experiences

### Consensus/Social Proof

People look up to those around them to inform their decision when they are uncertain with respect to a certain course of action to take. Cialdini defined social proof as people doing what they observe other people doing ("safety in numbers"
concept). For instance, if a co-worker works late, their colleagues are more likely to do the same. If a particular restaurant is always full of people, people are likelier to give that establishment a try.

People are more likely to be influenced by this principle if they are unsure of themselves or if they have a higher need or tendency for affiliation and as such, they tend to prefer the opinions of their targeted groups (in order to display
similarity and thus have higher chances of acceptance or membership). Social psychology is rife with experiments that illustrate this unavoidable, human phenomenon, but a classic one is this 1960s elevator experiment (basically, whatever the
majority of people do in an elevator, an individual who joins the group will copy). For example, if the group looks to the back of the elevator, the individual will do the same, even if it seems unnatural or useless.

Ratings are the best, and the most efficient implementation of this persuasion technique. Almost all e-commerce sites provide a rating system for the products they sell. Restaurants, bars, hotels and other service providers also have ratings
on various applications (for example Yelp, TripAdvisor or Airbnb). Ratings provide increase security for a purchase. If a significant number of people have provided a reasonable high score then, the product or service must be good enough for
other potential clients as well.

Have testimonials about the product or service is another great way to use "Social Consensus". Some personality types do not respond well to numbers, but can relate to other people experience. This is why aside from the rating system most sites
provide a testimonial or review section where authenticated users (proving a higher degree of credibility) can describe their experience with the purchase.

Social consensus can pe implied by tokens of proof. It is very common that sellers or service provides offer a high variety of options. It also very common to see various mentions about specific options like "best seller", "most popular" or
"community favoured". In some cases, they might provide rankings based on popularity or quality badges suggesting some sort of elaborate vetting process that ensures better services and increased security.

Finally, an indirect implementation of the "Social Consensus" refers to recommendation systems. Most seller or service provider provide some recommendations presented as "people have also viewed", "other people are viewing", "other people have
also bought" or even "bought together".

Out of the Big Five/OCEAN personality profiles, people high in Agreeableness or Neuroticism are more likely to respond to this persuasion technique. As previously discussed, Agreeable people are more compliant and value the opinions of others,
sometimes even more than their own opinions. They have a moderate need for affiliation, but in some groups (family, close friends) this need is very high. As a result, they are more likely to take decision based on the social consensus of
the groups they are part of. Agreeable people respond better to testimonials, where they can see the people that provided the testimonial and find similarities to themselves or people within their own social groups.

Neurotics favour "Social Consensus" as a result of their increased need for security and their tendency to fear being judged. If they make a purchase that is socially validated and widely accepted, it is very unlikely that they will be judged
or criticized for making that specific decision. They also use this argument to decrease their feeling of anxiety when making the actual purchase as they defer the responsibility and risks to the group that provides the consensus.

Highly Conscientious people do not respond well to consensus. While they are also part of social groups and recognize the validity of ratings and consensus, they are sceptical by nature and prefer the ratings, reviews or testimonials to come
from trusted sources. Another reason why people high in Conscientiousness do not respond well to this technique is the fact that they have difficulties relating to other people that are not Conscientious. For example, they might consider that
something what works for people Open to Experience would never fit in a stable, ordered daily plan.

### Liking

People are more likely to agree with or do things when asked by the people they like and that they believe like them back. "Liking" is based on sharing something similar or a more superficial interest, like physical attractiveness; or, if the
other person compliments us.

There are many ads and commercial in which very attractive people smile at us and then recommend a specific product, especially in the context of a very relatable situation. For example, most beauty or hygiene products present models that are
getting ready for a "common activity" (going to work, going out, relaxing and so on) and "because, just like you, they want to look their best" they are using a specific product or brand. Another common way of using "Liking" is presenting
a related person that compliments your choices or implies that your tastes, needs or desire are of a higher quality and thus make you better as a person. By creating this superficial connection, they suggest or recommend that a specific product
or brand is aligned with your needs and desires and that by choosing that you confirm that you deserve the compliment or implied positive quality.

Not all marketing strategies that use "Liking" are as shady as the previous case. A company that wants to boost conversion rates by using "Liking" can focus on creating and leading traffic to a great "About Us" page. A company‚Äôs "About Us" provides
great opportunity to tell potential customers about the similarities between its staff and the site visitors. Since similarity is a key building block of liking, an effective "About Us" page is vital. Another approach used by companies is
to showcase their employees. Instead of just referring to them as "the team" most companies now show pictures of their employees, share some data about them and provide a way to contact them individually in an effort to suggest similarities
between the employees and potential buyers.

Out of the Big Five/OCEAN personality profiles, Agreeable people are more likely to respond to this persuasion technique. Agreeable people value the opinion of others and if someone is similar, likable and polite then they are more likely to be very
persuasive.

Conscientious people are also defined by a strong "striving for achievement" trait and a result they literally like to be complimented and their qualities acknowledged, especially by someone who is similar, as it provides a form recognition of
their perceived merits. However, similarity is not enough to drive purchase; at best it can act as a product discovery mechanism leading to a possible purchase sometime in the future.

Highly Extrovert or Open to Experience people do not respond well to "Liking". Extroverts prefer to be in the spotlight and rarely accept sharing the attention. As such, similarity is more often seen as a competition rather than a positive aspect.
Striving for uniqueness does not fare well with similarity. However, if the person advertising a certain product is seen as having a higher social status, Extroverts might be inclined to consider a purchase in the hopes that it will confer
an increase in their status as well. People Open to Experience prefer to experiment, explore and decide on their own. As such, even if the person recommending a product or service is similar and likable, they are less likely to be convincing.

### Reciprocity

People have a tendency to pay back favours done to them. The idea of reciprocity says that people, by nature, feel obliged to provide discounts or concessions to others if they‚Äôve received favours from those people. Psychology explains this
by stressing that humans simply hate to feel indebted to others.

For example, let‚Äôs say that you‚Äôre running a popular blog that offers readers highly actionable and practical information to improve their lives. All of this information is offered for free to site visitors. Based on the idea of reciprocity,
your blog makes site visitors more likely to feel obligated to buy something from your site, providing you with an eventual conversion.

Basically, in order to employ "Reciprocity" you need to offer something first. The most common benefits provided are discounts, information or personalisation. It is a common marketing strategy for companies to provide courses, infographics,
lectures, case studies or even "unique magic formula to increase X" for free. Not only does this drive traffic to the site, but it also creates a reciprocity context for your potential customer. If the provided benefit proves helpful, then
the potential customer would be more likely to also purchase something. "Content Marking" is also a great example of this concept.

Not all business can provide something highly valuable, either due to the nature of their business, limited funds or lack of access to constructive materials. The alternative to providing a benefit is to provide some form of exclusivity. For
example, recommending a service to a friend is rewarded with a special or expensive benefit (exclusive access to enterprise features, limited access to paid content, larger storage, greater number of uses of a specific service and so on).

Finally, if you cannot get a person to visit your site to receive a benefit, and you cannot reward them for a specific beneficial action you can always send them a present. This has the similar effect to the other "Reciprocity" strategies, as
long as they know that it is from you. For example, in the last month Play Station Network has been randomly giving PSN credits as gifts to their customers, while during the start of the pandemic they gave out multiple free games and considerable
discounts to accommodate people staying more in their homes. Hygiene and beauty brands conduct gift giving campaigns in person, by mail or in speciality magazines, as samples almost every year. People that pre-order games, hardware or electronics
receive all sorts of bonuses, memorabilia, discounts or presents. Another widely adopted gift giving strategy is ever-present at conferences, where companies give away branded pens, notebooks, stress balls, gift bags, t-shirts and many other
things in the hopes of obtaining "Reciprocity".

People high in Conscientiousness or Agreeableness are most likely to respond to this technique. Conscientious people are less likely to be or feel in dept and through their organized and disciplined nature they tend to reciprocate. Agreeable
people are highly socially aware, modest and polite and as such have a strong tendency to return the favour.

Note, that the other personality profiles have a limited, but positive response to "Reciprocity". Due to a variety of factors (social norms, values, education, functional social skills, emotional intelligence, empathy and many others) the other
personality profiles might also feel the need, sometimes, to respond to "Reciprocity".

### Scarcity

The rarer a product is, the more people want it, or at least this is what most people believe. This means people are more likely to desire or demand a product if they are told it is hard to get. Scarcity is the perception that products are more
attractive when their availability is limited. We are likelier to purchase something if we‚Äôre informed that it‚Äôs the "last one" or that a "special deal" will soon expire. In short, people hate to miss out, and that fear is a powerful motivator
to encourage them to act quickly. Scarcity is one of the most popular Cialdini principles. Companies use it over and over again to try to boost conversions.

Many booking sites employ the scarcity principle in many ways: "Only Today 35% off!", "X people are looking at the same offer right now!" or "In very high demand ‚Äì only X rooms left on our site!". This approach also serves as an indirect "Social
Consensus" as it implies that the product or service is so good that is almost sold out. Other business, like retailers, provide time limited discounts on various products. It is very common to see counters or notifications that inform the
visitor that a specific price or offer will expire in a specific time interval.

In some cases, real scarcity can be used to increase value and conversion rates. For example, luxury brands, where handmade/crafted items can be produced in limited amounts, really benefit from this technique. In other cases, simulating scarcity
is also possible (for example, in the fashion industry) by not selling or discounting seasonal products. In this manner, even abundant products become scarce.

While this technique is widely used, only people Open to Experience and Extroverts might be persuaded by it, due to their desire to not miss out on something that is interesting or new. Extroverts tend to respond positivity to this technique
when it comes to travel or social events, due to their gregarious nature. They might also respond to the limited availability of luxury brands (that are unique or rare), but rarely respond to the scarcity persuasion technique related to common
purchases.

People high in Conscientiousness or Neuroticism do not respond well to this technique. Both personality types prefer to have sufficient time to evaluate the risks and utilitarian aspects of a purchase.
