# Market Segmentation: Complete Guide to Customer Targeting

## Introduction

**Market segmentation is the strategic process of dividing potential customers into distinct groups (segments) based on shared characteristics.** The fundamental principle is that people within each segment are more likely to have similar interests, needs, and responses to specific marketing strategies.

### Why Segment Instead of Mass Marketing?

Rather than targeting individual customers or using broad, generic messaging, market segmentation allows companies to:
- **Reach customers more efficiently** and cost-effectively
- **Create targeted messaging** that resonates with specific groups
- **Optimize marketing spend** by focusing on the most promising segments
- **Improve conversion rates** through relevant, personalized approaches

### The Two Main Segmentation Categories

1. **Demographics** - Observable characteristics (age, gender, income, location, occupation)
2. **Psychographics** - Psychological traits (personality, values, beliefs, lifestyle)

## Benefits of Market Segmentation

### 1. Create Stronger, More Specific Marketing Messages
**Develop custom-tailored messages** that address the unique needs, wants, and characteristics of each market segment.

**Example:** Men and women have different needs and preferences when purchasing electronic products, as do different age groups. Instead of using generic messages, segmentation allows you to address each segment's specific needs efficiently.

### 2. Identify the Most Effective Marketing Strategy
**Optimize channel selection** based on segment preferences, as different strategies produce different results for different customers.

**Example:** 
- **Social media marketing** works better for young adults
- **Traditional media** (newspapers, TV, radio) provides better results for seniors

### 3. Attract and Convert Quality Leads
**Target the right people with the right message.** Rather than investing large amounts on general ads and campaigns, focusing on people most likely to be interested in your product or service is:
- More cost-effective
- Higher conversion potential
- Better ROI

### 4. Differentiate Your Brand from Competitors
**Stand out by addressing specific segment needs** that competitors ignore or handle generically.

**Example:** While most soda companies target teenagers broadly, successful brands differentiate by creating separate campaigns for teenagers and adults (especially families), achieving higher success rates by addressing specific needs of each segment.

### 5. Enable Better Control and Measurement
**Simplify marketing management** through focused strategies and clearer metrics.

Segmentation enables you to:
- Track and measure ads, campaigns, and conversion rates more precisely
- Monitor satisfaction levels by segment
- Take specific, concrete actions to improve marketing processes
- Allocate resources more effectively

While there are many ways to segment a market, not all segmentation criteria are relevant. In order to gain the market segmentation benefits, proper attention and interest need to be invested in establishing proper market segments for your business. For example, hair colour might be a poor way to segment the market for bakery products.

Measurable
After market segmentation is done, we can clearly define the size, profile and purchasing power of each segment. This implies that we have access to reliable data (for example census data) or a reliable way of measuring segments. For example, knowing that your product is a perfect fit for people that have a specific height is not relevant as you do not have access to height data in specific regions, and the region average might differ from the overall country average. In a similar manner, purchase power, consumption rates, habits, cultural differences, physical characteristics and many other criteria, even if they would be very relevant for your market segmentation, are almost impossible to determine for specific regions (consider countries with high ethnic diversity, emergent economy or economic issues and so on).

Accessible
While the segments themselves might be correctly established, you also need to be able to reach these segments with your message and your products. For example, you can be certain that your product is best suited for VPs and CEOs (based on education, income, availability to spend, social expectations), but there are very few ways to reach top management people directly.

Substantial
The obtained segments should be relevant in terms of size and purchase capability. Having a segment that represents 97% of the population and the other segments consisting of 1% each is not a valid market segmentation.

Differential
Each segment is well defined by unique needs, desires and characteristics that do not overlap (as much as possible). This allows for specific approaches, messages and campaigns dedicated for each segment. If segments overlap then segmentation might not be useful. For example, marital status is not enough to differentiate segments when it comes to perfume preferences. Marital status overlaps with gender segments and age segments, leading to the inability to adress specific needs of the overlapping groups.

Actionable
Depending on the approach, segments might be too difficult or too expensive to reach. Even if the segmentation is correct, the inability to take proper actions towards marketing to specific segments makes these segments useless. The goal is to create segments for which you are able to take actions (implicitly create and run your marketing campaigns) and then be able to evaluate the results.

Taking into account these requirements we can define two main criteria for market segmentation:

Demographics (gender, age, race, geographic location, occupation, religion)
Psychographics (personality, values, principles, beliefs).

What are Demographics?
Demographics is the study of a population based on factors such as age, race, and biological sex. Demographic data also refers to socio-economic information expressed statistically, also including employment, education, income, marriage rates, birth and death rates and other factors.

While sometime treated separately, demographics may also include criteria determined by geographic location like nationality, political views, religious views and social status (social classes, cast systems, unique or special groups, minorities, migrant population, migrant work force and so on).
Governments, corporations, and nongovernment organizations use demographics to learn more about a population's characteristics for many purposes, including policy development and economic market research.

Demographics provide the most common criteria for market segmentation as the data is publicly accesible and constantly updated by governments, international organisations and private companies.

Biological Sex Segmentation
Research shows that men tend to use one side of their brain (particularly the left side for verbal reasoning) while women tend to use both cerebral areas for visual, verbal and emotional responses. These differences in the way the brain functions causes differences in behaviour between men and women.

Women tend to be better at sensing emotional messages in conversations, gestures, and facial expressions, and are thus considered to be more sensitive than men. Women start to speak and read at an earlier age than men and are generally better in verbal skills, such as learning a different language. They tend to have a better grasp on grammar and spelling, and generally girls have better handwriting than boys do. Women have better sight at night and have a more acute sense of smell, taste and hearing.

Women are better at multi-tasking, especially if some of the tasks refer to communication, have better distributed attention and tend to have better defined preferences.

In terms of marketing and purchases, women are more attentive to prices and tend to give a higher importance to bargains, promotions and discounts. Women tend to need a higher sense of security when shopping, especially online; they appreciate good customer service and value the way the process of acquisition made them feel. Studies also show that more women engage in more hedonistic shopping, compared to men.

Statistically, men have increased spatial coordination and a more efficient sense of direction. They tend to excel in mathematics and are great at interpreting three-dimensional objects. They tend to have a better hand-eye coordination and more precise control of large muscle movement. They have poor peripheral vision but better sight in bright light and a better sense of perspective. Since they use one side of their brain more than the other, they tend to use the left side for verbal reasoning and the right for visual and emotional activities (if they are right-handed).

In terms of marketing, men are more utilitarian in their purchases, with the majority of men defining their purchase as being able to solve a specific problem. Price is less relevant for the purchase and they rarely engage in window shopping, except for expensive, luxury products and brands.

Obviously, these differences are not rules. It is easy to find women who excel in mathematics and men who have excellent language skills (and it is even easier to find men with a limited sense of direction). Chances are the above statements are not going to work for your everyday situations, but these have been shown to be statistically relevant in scientific studies, based on large, diverse populations. When looking at large populations, these differences between men and women become obvious.

Age Segmentation
Age is one of the most important segmentation criteria, especially taking into account that preferences change with age. Almost all marketing campaigns target age-specific audiences.

Age based market segmentation usually considers specific age ranges or life cycle stages: babies, children, adolescents, adults, middle-age, and seniors. For example, many famous fashion designers have different collections to target different age groups. They aim certain clothing lines at specific age ranges, such as a chic fashion lines at younger prospects, and more formal and elegant lines at older individuals.

Age segmentation can also be generation-based: baby boomers, generation X, millennials, etc. Since members within each of these individual groups were born around the same time and grew up with similar experiences, they often share similar characteristics, preferences and values. Targeting baby boomers and generation X with the same offer and marketing strategy is likely to produce undesirable results because they think and act differently. Also, due to their age difference, they statistically vary in needs and desires.

Not only do age groups and generations differ in their buying habits, but also in how they respond to advertising. Age segements tend to have distinct ways of speaking and often spend their time on different information channels (TV, social media, newspapers). For example, millennials may spend most of their time on Instagram and Facebook, while seniors prefer their email inboxes and newspapers.

Age is negatively associated with using smartphones for texting, browsing the internet, and playing music. This means that the older the person the less likely they are to engage in social media usage and interactions. Social media emerged as one of the most important marketing channels in last decade because it is now used by more than two and a half billion people. But it is not as popular among older generations as it is among the younger generation. While 86% of the people below 29 years of age use social media, the percentage is only 34% for individuals who are 65 and above. Similarly, Facebook and Twitter are popular among all age groups, but Instagram and Snapchat are most popular among younger people, mostly generation Z. Another example, while 36% of 65-years-olds use Facebook, the percentage is only 5% for Instagram for the same age group and even less for Snapchat.

Income and Occupation Segmentation
If people can’t afford your product or service, there is no point in targeting them. After all, you wouldn’t promote a luxury car to someone who can’t afford a used vehicle. However, keep in mind that there is no such thing as negative publicity, and having your brand known by everyone has its advantages, as long as you target actual potential customers first.

Income targeting lets you measure the buying power of your potential customers. When you know the income range of consumers, you can usually find data to support how people spend money on both the higher and lower end of the spectrum. Many companies use this data to sell different tiers of the same product, based on income level. For instance, airlines have three classes: economy, business class, and first class. Occupation is strongly linked with income. Aside from this, ocupational targeting is also important as certain products or services are aimed at different industries and job positions.

Education Segmentation
Based on their level of education, potential customers will respond to different messages, ad formats, campaigns, proposed value and channels. Studies show that the higher the education the more a person is likely to own a smartphone and have access to mobile internet. However, the higher the education the lower their activity on social media and random internet sites. At a high level of education, the internet becomes an utilitarian tool (checking e-mails, status updates, keeping in touch with business personnel and so on), rather than an entertainment one (less time and interest in games, entertainment and casual news).

A basic segmentation based on education level may contain:

Migrants/Non-native speakers with limited language proficiency:

Simple messages
TV based campaigns
Poster/Print campaigns
Less likely to follow ads in a foreign language or buy from foreign sites
Very low purchase power
Minimum mandatory education:

High use of TV and home Internet
High use of social media
Less likely to have smartphone or constant internet access (as it is expensive in many countries)
Would respond to simple poster/print ads, especially if they contain images that attract attention
Very low purchase power
Likely to make impulse purchase (including taking out a loan)
Rarely care about service quality, except when prices are very high
High School:

High Internet, low TV
Less likely to respond to print materials
More likely to respond to smartphone/internet ads
Low purchase power
Some products, with small prices are very likely the preferred acquisitions
Likely to make impulse purchase (limited loans)
May accept services of moderate quality
University:

Moderate Internet, low TV
Conservative, might respond to print ads
High Purchase Power
Interested in value, price and return on investment
Need sufficient information to make informed decisions
Expect quality services
Doctorate:

Low Internet, low TV
Will respond to print
Very high purchase power
Most likely to make only informed decisions
Expect quality services

What is Geographic Segmentation?
Geographic segmentation refers to dividing the market based on geographic location. There are multiple ways that a market can be geographically segmented. You can divide your market by geographical areas, such as by city, county, state, regions (like the East and West Coast), country, or international regions (like continents). You can also divide the market into rural, suburban, and urban market segments. And, you can segment a market by climate or total population in each area.

Advantages of geographic segmentation:

It's an effective approach for companies with large national or international markets because different consumers in different regions have different needs, wants, and cultural characteristics that can be specifically targeted.
It can be an effective approach for small businesses with a limited budget. They can focus on directly accessible areas and not spend their marketing bugdets on approaches less efficient for their target geographic segment.
It works well when segmenting based on areas with different population density. Consumers in an urban area usually have different needs and wants than people in suburban and rural environments. There are even cultural differences between these three areas.
It's relatively easy to break your market down to geographic segments.
Geographic segmentation also comes with a series of constraints:

Your services or products are competitive, needed or essential in the targeted regions. For example, marketing oranges in southern Europe might not be a good idea considering that these regions are the biggest producers of oranges in Europe.
Being able to deliver your goods or services in that region, taking into account costs, storage, transport, specific laws and taxes. For example, ordering products from another continent increases the time of delivery, the costs of delivery and in many cases involves 3rd parties that might not provide the same quality services as you.
Ability to honour warranty in a time efficient and cost-effective manner. If a client has a problem with a refrigerator they bought from you they might not be willing to wait several days before you can repair it and send it back. Also, the costs of sending products back and forth need to be taken into account.
Possibility to provide customer support, in the spoken language of the region. You might provide services or products to a region but people might have questions and issues that you need to be able to address. Imagine providing support in French in a non-francophone country.
Cultural differences might prevent you from selling your product or providing your services. Holidays, festivals, traditions, cultural restrictions (alcohol, certain type of meat, preferred clothing styles and clothing materials and so on) may prevent you from doing business in an efficient way in those regions. Obviously, these factors might also prove great advantages if used properly.
Geographic segmentation provides a better view of the channels and strategies that may be used for marketing. For example, in some regions reading is high and watching TV is low, while the opposite may the true in other regions. In some countries, social media usage is high, while in others is limited. Taking location into account will help you develop marketing strategies that get your message across to the relevant customers in a relevant manner.

Cultural Preferences Segmentation
Many companies practice cultural-based geographic marketing. Fast food and restaurant businesses are a prime example. McDonald’s serves beer in their German restaurants, but not in the US, which reflects the difference in drinking preferences between the two cultures. They’ve also incorporated local foods on their menu in some locations — the “McArabia” in the Middle East, banana pie in Brazil, and the “McVeggie”, salsa bean burger, and other unique items in India. Seafood is heavily marketed along the East and West coasts, in the USA, since there is a constant supply of fresh seafood throughout the year. In Asian countries, eating habits may be highly dependent on religious ceremonies. For example, the Chinese eat dumplings during the Spring festival in honour of their relationship with God.

Living Conditions Segmentation
People living in urban, suburban, and rural areas often have contrasting wants and needs, so to make advertising more personalized, geographic segmentation is needed. An obvious example is marketing lawnmowers to rural and suburban communities where most residents have yards and would need a lawnmower.

People living in their own house and apartments are more likely to invest in their living accommodation in terms of furniture, electronics and aesthetics. Owning the house or apartment also indicates either high income (implicitly high possibility for spending) or good credit scores (implying a stable job, ability to take out loans and paying them on time and so no).

Climate Segmentation
As its name suggests, climate-based segmentation involves marketing products based on a particular region’s climate. In this approach we consider goods and services to be seasonal.

For example, brands that typically sell winter apparel should market their products in areas that are cold all year-round, because they’d probably fail to profit by marketing to warmer climates, here the need for their products does not exist. Swimwear brands, on the other hand, should target warmer climates — areas with beaches and resorts, because that’s where they’ll generate the most business. Retailers that sells products for multiple climates and conditions should advertise their winter gear in the fall and winter months, and their summer gear in the spring and summer months.
