#;Tactic;Description/Hypothesis;Image;Funnel Step;Tag;Requires Budget?;Effort;Dev Needed?;
1;Upgrade to Annual Plan;"After someone's been a couple of months on a monthly plan, offer them to upgrade to an annual plan and get x months for free.
If someone's been using your product for at least a year, such a decision should be a no-brainer for them. Experiment with the optimal number of months before sending the upgrade prompt (6-8 should be a good starting point).
Use email and in-app live chat to communicate the offer. Also, placing it near invoices and in your product's payment section (where they see the amount of money they're paying you) should be an effective way to convince users how reasonable it is to switch to an annual plan.";;Revenue Retention;;No;Low;No;
2;Reframing Discounts;"Instead of having two options for your subscription plan length - monthly and annual, test having only the monthly one and display the annual plan as an option to choose a discount (see screenshot).
This way, users are not making a choice between plan durations but between getting a discount or not.
S/o to Manuel Friger who came up with this tactic: https://manuel.friger.io/blog/how-reframing- discounts-led-to-a-4x-increase-in-yearly -plans/";;Revenue;pricing;No;Low;Yes;
3;Temporarily Unlock a Feature;Unlock a premium feature of your product to free tier users for a short period a time. Make them know what they're missing out on by not upgrading their plan. Two biases occur here: loss aversion and endowment effect.;;Revenue;;No;Moderate;Yes;
4;Premium Features Visible for Free Tier Users;Show free tier users what features they're missing out on by not upgrading to a premium plan. E.g. place an overlay with an upgrade button over them.;;Revenue;;No;Low;Yes;
5;Don't Log Users Out;"Extend the cookie length to some long period of time
e.g. 30 days and ask to authenticate (e.g. log in again) only at sensitive steps, like purchase. This will make more users return to your product thanks to removed friction.";;Revenue Retention;;No;Low;Yes;
6;Shorter Trial Length;"Based on Redpoint Ventures' data, free trial length has no meaningful impact on free to premium conversion rate.
Main benefits of having a shorter trial period:
- users will know they have less time to check out your product and be more proactive during the trial
- shorter trial periods mean shorter SaaS sales
cycles and lower customer acquisition costs
- youʼre able to conduct more testing, which allows you to learn faster and iterate faster
Note: always take into account the time it takes users to see the value in your product.";;Revenue;;No;Low;Yes;
7;Switch to Value-Based Pricing;"Charge customers for the value they're getting out of your product e.g. per user, per dashboard, per 100 visits, etc. rather than for features.
Some of the benefits include:
- allowing users to start using the product at a low cost which reduces the barrier to entry
- charging customers proportionally to the value they
receive (making them more satisfied, which helps retention)
- expanding your TAM by making the product accessible for lower market customers
Value-based pricing has also been proven to drive higher ARPU (by over 20% per ProfitWell research).";;Revenue;pricing;No;High;Yes;
8;Competitors Comparison on Pricing Page;Compare your prices to competing products. If your target market is price-sensitive people who do competitive research (and most do), this is how you wanna design your pricing page.;;Revenue;competitors;No;Low;No;
9;Pricing Add-Ons;Leverage add-ons (additional features paid extra) to increase ARPU. You should consider stripping your plans out of a feature and turning it into an add-on when it's used by less than 20% of your paying users.;;Revenue;pricing;No;High;Yes;
10;Life of Current Price;Create urgency by saying that the current price of a product lasts until X. People will feel the need to make a decision faster.;;Revenue;pricing;No;Low;No;
11;Pricing Page Copy Headline Fix;Don't waste the precious real estate on your pricing page on vague headlines like 'Simple and transparent pricing' or 'Pricing that grows with your needs'. Instead, use it to reiterate the benefits your users are going to get if they decide to try your product.;;Revenue;pricing;No;Low;No;
12;Rule of 100;Give percentage discounts on prices below $100 and absolute discounts above that value. If you're using site-wide discounting use the $100 threshold for average order value at your store. This will increase their perceived size and make users feel like they're getting an even better deal.;;Revenue;pricing;No;Low;No;
13;ROI Calculator;"If you can clearly show how much tangible results your product can bring your customers, a good way to demonstrate it is by using a calculator. This will give you a powerful lever in convincing them that the pricing you offer is right and your product can generate a positive ROI for them.
Good examples: exitintelligence.com/pricing-roi & https://brightback.com/roi-calculator";;Revenue;pricing;No;Moderate;Yes;
14;Offer a Guarantee;"If you have a really solid product with very low return and complaint rates you should consider offering a guarantee.
Guarantees are effective when:
- users want what the company is promising
- users are nervous about the risk associated with buying the product or skeptical about your claims
- your service does live up to the claims you make
The best guarantees are worded positively. E.g. instead of saying “If you dislike our service…” say, “We guarantee that youʼll love our service.”";;Revenue;;No;Low;No;
15;Expensive First;"In your pricing tables, sort plans from the most expensive to the least expensive. This should result in an increase in more revenue generated. Why?
There are actually 2 possible cognitive biases that have an effect here:
1. Anchoring - when users evaluate a list of products, they use the initial prices they see to generate their reference price. Lower price seems like a better deal
-> more people buy.
2. Loss Aversion - after seeing the plan with the best features first, others seem to be less valuable and users prefer higher plans -> higher ARPU.";;Revenue;pricing;No;Low;No;
16;Outcome Value Metrics over Feature Differentiation;"Differentiate your pricing plans based on a value metric instead of features. As Patrick Campbell of ProfitWell says: price is the exchange rate for the value you're creating with your product. Thus, it should be increasing with the increasing value of your product to your users.
Outcome value metrics (e.g. how much money you made your customer, how many views your video got etc.) are highly correlated with lower churn - ProfitWell research indicates it's almost 3x lower than when using feature differentiation (screenshot).
Also, when comparing companies who use a value metric to those who donʼt, youʼll note that those utilizing value metrics are growing at nearly double the rate as those deploying strictly feature differentiation (ProfitWell data).";;Revenue;pricing;No;High;Yes;
17;Upgrade or Data Deleted;Incentivize users whose trial ended to purchase a paid plan by informing them that their app data will get deleted if they don't upgrade their account. You can offer them a discount as an extra push.;;Revenue;;No;Low;No;
18;The 'Ugly Brother' Effect;"Add a slightly ""uglier"" (less valuable, less beautiful) version of your main product/service for the same price. Users will view the base product as more attractive and will be more willing to choose it.";;Revenue;;No;Low;No;
19;Pricing - Decoy Effect;"Made famous by The Economist magazine's pricing page (they still use it, so it's been probably working well for them), decoy effect is a cognitive bias where people change their preferences regarding two options when a third, asymmetrically dominated, is introduced.
I.e. when there are only two options - people make a choice based on their personal preferences. But when offered a third option (priced a little lower than the most expensive one and/or with much worse features), they are more likely to choose the more expensive of the two original options.";;Revenue;pricing;No;Low;No;
20;Price Partitioning;Price partitioning means the division of a productʼs price into several components, provided that the components cannot be bought separately. Create an impression that the base product itself is priced reasonably but add-ons or upgrades can be bought additionally.;;Revenue;pricing;No;Low;No;
21;Pricing Localization;"ProfitWell, in an analysis of 457 SaaS companies, found that those with a greater focus on localization were growing faster. Starting from simple changes like converting prices to local currency, you should make sure your pricing is adjusted to the main regions you do business in.
Two types of localization:
1. cosmetic localization - converting price to local currency, translating your website to more languages
2. true market localization - pricing based on market saturation and willingness to pay
Remember - different regions have different willingness to pay, so your pricing approach should mirror that.";;Revenue;pricing;No;Moderate;Yes;
22;Upgrade Prompt Before Plan Limit;"Prompt users getting close to their plan resources limits to upgrade to a higher plan. Don't let the limits stop them from using your product when they'll need it (e.g. a user might want to create a new campaign on a short notice using your tool but learns there are no credits left - she then has to wait for her supervisor to upgrade the account and the campaign doesn't go out on time).
Use positive wording for the message e.g. ""Great job! You've sent 4995 emails this month. There's only 5 left in your plan. Reach even more people by upgrading your account.""";;Revenue;;No;Moderate;Yes;
23;Contact a Coworker;Reach out to people who are decision-makers (or just other people at relevant positions) at companies that signed up for your trial but didn't purchase a premium plan. The original person who signed up thought your product is right for their company's needs but for some reason didn't upgrade their account. There's a chance they weren't in the position to make the purchase, got busy, forgot about it, or some other reason. Contacting a different person might produce better results and since you can find their email/LinkedIn in no time, it's definitely worth trying.;;Revenue;things that don'…;No;Low;No;
24;Tunnel Checkout;Remove header and footer from checkout to create a distraction-free 'tunnel'. Reducing the number of options a user has will increase the chance they will perform the action you want them to take and proceed further in the checkout process.;;Revenue;checkout;No;Low;Yes;
25;Remove Coupon Fields from Checkout;Seeing a coupon code field makes people (without coupon codes) wonder why haven't they received a promo code and others have. A part of them will leave your site in search of a code and never come back again if they don't find one. A good solution is to have the coupon code field hidden under a link that opens it on click. Just make sure it's not too explicit.;;Revenue;checkout;No;Low;Yes;
26;Reframe Price into Daily Cost;Show how much your product costs per day, next to the monthly price e.g. $30/month, that's just $1/day.;;Revenue;pricing;No;Low;No;
27;Move Account Creation After Purchase;Don't make users create accounts before checking out. Always allow for guest checkout. You can collect more information from them after the purchase.;;Revenue;checkout;No;Moderate;Yes;
28;'Upsell' on Thank You Page;"This is a moment when users' motivation is high. They've also already developed a certain level of trust by converting for the first time. That's why they're more likely to take another action now. Or, refer a friend. Plus, you already have their contact info, so they don't have to input it again to convert once more. This tactic leverages what's called a 'yes ladder', or 'foot in the door' technique. Once someone says 'yes' once, they're more likely to say 'yes' once more.
Note: don't ever do this after users sign up for your app. Your goal then is to get them to see the value of your product asap and you shouldn't distract them.";;Revenue;;No;Low;Yes;
29;Trust Seals at Checkout;"Trust seals make customers feel more comfortable handing over their sensitive information to you and increase your conversions. In general, the less known your brand is, the more of an impact they will have.
Go for the badges that you think your visitors will be
most familiar with.";;Revenue;checkout;No;Low;Yes;
30;Cause-Based Incentives;'For each purchase we donate $10 to charity X'. Make sure to choose a charity that's close to your target audience's interest.;;Revenue;;No;Low;No;
31;Don't Remove Absent Features From Pricing Plans;Use FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) to incentivize users to select more expensive plans. Show absent features in lower plans to make sure users know what they are missing out on by not choosing a higher plan.;;Revenue;pricing;No;Low;No;
32;Specific Numbers in Pricing Tables;Using specific numbers is more credible than using generic phrases. E.g. use '63% of users' instead of 'most popular' as most companies do.;;Revenue;pricing;No;Low;No;
33;Display Prices in Small Font Size;Your prices will be perceived as smaller when they're displayed in small font and positioned next to larger elements. If you're using discounting, make the discounted price large to further enhance this effect.;;Revenue;pricing;No;Low;No;
34;Click to Tweet;"Add a click to tweet link in your blogposts to make it easy for users to share the best parts of your articles.
Tool: clicktotweet.com";;Referral;content;No;Low;No;
35;Referral Contest;"B2C: Incentivize users to engage and share your content by running a contest, where users are rewarded for each referral action with points.
Participants who gather the most points receive access to your product or get prizes related to your product. Make sure to give some small reward also to those users that participated but didn't get the main prizes. You can offer them a discount for your product.
Example tools: viral-loops.com, vyper.io";;Referral;;Yes;Moderate;Yes;
36;Generate Referrals From Invoices;Encourage users to refer others by placing a referral link in your invoice email (and billing page in your product). The moment they see the invoice is likely to be the time they're most motivated to save thus will be also likely to take the action that you'll present them.;;Referral;;No;Moderate;Yes;
37;Easter Egg Marketing;"Hide special features of your product and make them known initially only to a small group of users.
Example: Snapchat's black & white filter. Easter eggs
are powerful as they go against users' expectations. People love knowing secrets but they like to share them even more - other users who see them will start asking how you did it -> instant virality.";;Referral;;No;High;Yes;
38;Invite Prompt During Onboarding;If your product benefits from being used by more than one user, add a prompt to invite more team members after the initial signup, during onboarding. Explain how collaboration will bring more value to your users.;;Referral;onboarding;No;Moderate;Yes;
39;Refer Friends to Unlock a Feature;Incentivize sharing of your app by letting users on free plan unlock some premium features by referring others.;;Referral;;No;High;Yes;
40;Invite from Address Book;"Make the referral process a seamless experience for your users by letting them invite others from all their address books like Gmail, Outlook, and others. Not having them remember or type their friends'/colleagues' emails will greatly increase the number of invites sent per user.
Tool: cloudsponge.com";;Referral;;Yes;Moderate;Yes;
41;Downgrade Trial to a Forever Free Plan;After the trial ends, downgrade it to a forever free plan with very limited features. This way you're not losing users and still have a chance of converting them to a paid plan.;;Retention;;No;Moderate;Yes;
42;Incentivized User Interview;After the trial ends, offer users an interview about the experience of using your product in exchange for a discount on a paid plan or first month for free.;;Retention;;No;Low;No;
43;Social Resurrection;"Bring back inactive users by leveraging other people in the users' network. When they join your product or reach an important milestone in it, let your inactive users know about it.
What this does is:
a) inactive users learn that their connections see value in your product (social proof)
b) inactive users are reminded to come back to your product by their connections and not you, which is more effective";;Retention;email;No;High;Yes;
44;Send Handwritten Cards to Customers;Celebrate accomplishments in app/milestones/anniversaries by sending handwritten cards to your customers. This will help you build a better relationship as few companies do this.;;Retention;things that don'…;No;Moderate;No;
45;Customize CTA Copy to Section Content;Don't use the same CTA copy throughout your pages. Make sure that they're relevant to the copy they follow.;;Acquisition;copy;No;Low;No;
46;Crowdsource Feature Ideas;"Encourage your users to let you know which features they'd like to have in your product/what new courses they'd like to see etc. Make it easy for them by placing a voting widget inside your product. It's a win-win situation: your users get features they actually need and feel heard, and you get quality feedback on what to build next.
Example tool: nolt.io";;Retention;;No;Moderate;Yes;
47;Exit Survey;"Gather crucial qualitative feedback from users who no longer want to use your product.
Ask them about the reason they're leaving, what (if any) tool they'll be switching to, what did they like about your product the most etc. Additionally, use conditional logic to get more detailed answers e.g. if the reason for churning was lack of features, ask them what features would make them stay. Make it as easy as possible to fill out to maximize the # of answers. It's important to include open-ended questions to get more insightful answers.
If you offer a free trial, try to get feedback from both trial users who didn't upgrade and paid users who churned. Ask for it both in-app and by email.";;Retention;survey;No;Moderate;No;
48;Gamified Free Trial Extension;Give users extra trial days for using more product features or performing social actions e.g. inviting friends/sharing your content. If they really need more time to evaluate your product, these actions will give them a chance to see the value of it and make them more likely to upgrade to a paid plan.;;Retention;gamification;No;High;Yes;
49;Community for Customers;Keep your customers up to date with all the latest tips and best practices of using your product by creating a community (Slack, Facebook group etc.). They are like an in-app live chat but more powerful. Users can get to know each other, exchange knowledge and talk about how each of them uses your product. This results in leveling up your users' expertise in using your product, which makes them more likely to keep using it for longer.;;Retention;;No;High;No;
50;Account Pause;Let users pause their accounts instead of canceling their subscription. They may have periods when they don't need your product but will want to use it again soon. This way they will be more likely to unpause and come back in the future than if they canceled and lost their data.;;Retention;;No;Moderate;Yes;
51;Reactivation Loops;Make active users continuously pull inactive users back to the product, reminding them of the core value. E.g. when you're endorsed on LinkedIn, you not only get an email but an app notification as well. More importantly, LinkedIn encourages you to keep the momentum going by endorsing other people in your network (who hopefully will do the same thing).;;Retention;;No;Moderate;Yes;
52;Newsletter Segmented by Topic;Segment your newsletter subscribers and offer them content only on the specific topics that they're interested in. This will result in higher engagement with the content you send them.;;Retention;email;No;Moderate;No;
53;Downsell On Cancellation;Try offering a lower-priced package/product when users are about to churn or remove products from their cart. Chances are it's because of the price being too high for them.;;Retention;content;No;Moderate;Yes;
54;Use Signin Page to Show Product Updates;Use the otherwise unused space of your sign-in page to notify your users about new product updates. This will help faster feature adoption, which will make users get more value from your product, which in turn will improve their retention.;;Retention;;No;Low;Yes;
55;'Happy Birthday' Reactivation Email;"Use this tactic as a final attempt to bring inactive users back. It relies on the same logic as Birthday Paradox - in a room of 23 people, there's a 50% chance that 2 of them have a birthday on the same day. If you apply this to your email list, there's a big chance that a part of them just had, or will soon have a birthday. To target an even larger group of people, say 'Happy (belated) Birthday' in the subject line.
Then just say that you're sorry you missed their birthday but have a special promo for them. It's hard to imagine someone reacting in a negative way to birthday wishes and a promo offer.";;Retention;email;No;Low;No;
56;Facebook Messenger Newsletters;"Send newsletter in Facebook Messenger and leverage open rates and CTRs a couple of times higher than when using email.
Tool: mailport.io";;Activation Revenue Retention;email     social;Yes;Low;No;
57;Create a Calculator;"If your product or service saves money / allows to make more money in a predictable way, use a calculator that allows users to calculate their gains thanks to using your product or service. This makes it much easier to show a positive ROI of your offering. Of course, you can use a calculator to show gains in traffic, conversions etc. and not only money. Good example: https://exitintelligence.com/pricing- roi/
Tools (if you don't feel like coding it): https://www.involve.me/calculator/ https://outgrow.co/calculator/";;Activation Revenue;engineering as …;No;Moderate;Yes;
58;Gamified Activation;Utilize stuff like leaderboards, badges for completing tasks, and other rewards that encourage engagement with your product.;;Activation     Referral;gamification;No;Moderate;Yes;
59;Reactivation Email;"After a user has been inactive for a given amount of time, send them a reminder email encouraging to return to your product.
You can also offer them extra credits as an incentive.";;Activation Retention;email;No;Low;No;
60;Personal Welcome from Founder;Display a personal message from the founder to users after signing up for your product. Basecamp does this well with a welcome note from Jason Fried, saying that users can contact him anytime in case of questions and gives them his email and Twitter handle. This simple move adds a personal touch and makes users feel welcome.;;Activation Retention;email onboarding;No;Low;No;
61;Search Box Inside Email;Increase email click rates by including a search box in email copy. Make sure that the landing page also has a search functionality.;;Activation Retention;email;No;Low;No;
62;Personalized App Dashboard;"Personalize app dashboard using user's company logo and colors. Make them feel like they own it. This creates an endowment effect - humans place a greater value on things once they have established ownership. This way they will be reluctant to part with your product.
Tool: https://www.brandfetch.io/personalization-api";;Activation Retention;personalization;No;Moderate;Yes;
63;Summary Email;Send a weekly/biweekly summary of users' activity/accomplishments in your app via email. If possible, let them know the positive effects your app made on their life/business e.g. 'last week our app helped you generate extra 57 leads'. Seeing tangible effects will make users want to stick to your product for a long time.;;Activation Retention;email;No;Moderate;Yes;
64;Reactivation Email;Send an email after a period of inactivity encouraging users to go back to your product. You can incentivize them e.g. by giving them credits to use your product - they just need to return to the app to claim them.;;Activation Retention;email;No;Moderate;No;
65;Behavioral Emails;Send automated emails based on user activity and behavior in the app. E.g. encourage to finish what they started, congratulate on reaching a milestone etc.;;Activation Retention;email;No;Moderate;Yes;
66;Search Autocomplete;"Adding or improving (autocomplete) on a search box will increase the average search length by 1.6 words (from 1.7 to 3.3) (Nachoanalytics data). Having good auto-complete changes what gets searched, making the searches more specific and relevant. And by making the searches more specific, the quality of the search result becomes better, making people more likely to click on them. So as search length increases so does the conversion rate.
You can track the quality of your search results performance by measuring the CTR from your search results page.";;Activation;;No;Moderate;Yes;
67;Offer a Trial Extension;After a user ends their free trial period and doesn't decide to upgrade to a paid plan yet, offer to extend their trial. Some users may need more time to get value from your product than others, others may have just forgotten about it but still want to try it out. Also, make it easy for them to extend it on their own, with one click, after they return to app.;;Activation;;No;Moderate;Yes;
68;Reactivate Old Trial Users;Create a custom audience of users who went  through a trial of your product but didn't upgrade. Show them ads announcing new features to encourage them to come back and give your product another shot. This audience should be more cost- effective to re-acquire than acquiring a cold user.;;Activation;ads;Yes;Moderate;No;
69;Leverage Empty States;"Empty states are screens in your app that don't contain any information yet. When neglected, users may feel left alone and don't know the next steps they need to take to get value from your product.
They should be used to encourage users to interact with your app and show the specific actions you want them to take. E.g. add a call to action, add an arrow pointing to the UI element you want them to click, display tips etc.";;Activation;;No;Moderate;Yes;
70;Extended Trial Drip;Extend your trial drip beyond the trial duration. As a part of users will convert a couple of days after the trial ends, it's important to stay on top of their minds until they are ready to make the purchase.;;Activation;email;No;Moderate;No;
71;Free Premium Trial;"Offer a limited-time free trial of your premium plan to freemium users. This way you're showing them what they're missing out on by not upgrading their account.
They will be able to use the premium features of your product, (hopefully) experience the extra value, and once the trial ends, they'll be more likely to upgrade their subscription.
Why does this work?
Endowment effect - we don't like to lose things we own (even for a short period of time). We tend to become extremely attracted to objects in our possession, and feel anxious to give them up.";;Activation;;No;Moderate;Yes;
72;Rewards for Using More Features;Give app credits for using more app features. This incentivizes users to use your app more, which increases the chance of them seeing the value of your app. This, plus the free credits, makes them more likely to upgrade to a paid plan and keep using it. After they get the free credits, they will just feel the need to use them (and the premium app account) - it's like free money after all.;;Activation;gamification;No;High;Yes;
73;Personal Onboarding;"In the early stages of growing your product, doing the onboarding process personally is a great way to meet and talk to your users. They'll be getting premium training and become better at using your product, plus feel the exclusivity of the personal treatment, thus value your product more.
An example of this tactic performed almost faultlessly is Superhuman, who still onboard every single user personally, even though their user base is in thousands.
Although it's a high-touch and time-consuming process, you'll be able to get invaluable insights about your users and their experience with your product.";;Activation;onboarding things that don'…;No;High;No;
74;Checklist in Email;Include a checklist in your onboarding emails to specify which actions users should take first in order to fully take advantage of your product's capabilities. Mark the first step (signup) complete to make it work as a small win for the user. Need to complete is a psychological effect that makes humans motivated  to finish a set of tasks for the sole sake of getting the satisfaction of completing them. People just donʼt  like to leave things incomplete.;;Activation;email onboarding;No;Moderate;Yes;
75;Reiterate Product Benefits During Onboarding;"Remind users about the benefits your product will bring them in order to increase the activation rate. This will make them more likely to actively use it as they'll want to experience these benefits themselves.
E.g. the average amount of time your users save, average increase in CTR etc.";;Activation;onboarding;No;Low;Yes;
76;Welcome to X from Founder + CC;Send a welcome email addressed directly from the founder, where you introduce (and CC) your product and/or support person. Let users know that they can reach out to the most competent people at your team. Make them feel important.;;Activation;email;No;Low;No;
77;Sequential Retargeting;"Sequential retargeting is the practice of varying the ad offer depending on where the visitor is in the conversion process, with the end goal of pushing them along. The first ad is trying to get the sale as fast as possible. If that doesnʼt happen within a certain amount of time, then the sequential ads are pushed live one by one. Example: you're retargeting visitors to your product pages:
1st ad: drive to signup 2nd ad: case study #1 3rd ad: case study #2 4th ad: ebook";;Activation;ads;Yes;Moderate;No;
78;Incentivized Onboarding Checklist;Take your in-app onboarding checklist to a higher level by offering something in return for completing action items. Examples: app credits for watching a tutorial video, extra points for installing the app code snippet on their website. This should increase the number of events per user at the onboarding stage, creating more users who reach the aha moment.;;Activation;onboarding;No;High;Yes;
79;Personalize Onboarding Based on User Type;The more relevant experience you provide during onboarding, the more your users will be likely to see the value your product provides. To do this, add an additional field(s) to the signup form and customize the experience based on its input. E.g. Canva displays templates matching the needs of their specific personas.;;Activation;onboarding personalization;No;High;Yes;
80;Retargeting App Users;Use GDN/FB to push users to perform next actions in app.;;Activation;ads;Yes;Moderate;Yes;
81;Onboarding Checklist;"Using a checklist in your in-app onboarding flow helps users go through the steps that you define as key to getting to the aha moment as quickly as possible.
How to make it seem easier to complete:
- cross out the already completed actions (completion bias)
- add the time each task takes to complete (if short)";;Activation;onboarding;No;Moderate;Yes;
82;Fake Supply;"When starting a two-sided platform, the easiest way to accelerate growth is to grow the supply i.e. 'seller' side first.
Take Tinder as an example - the “supply” of (attractive) women on their platform is what triggers the participation of men (""demand"").
To make this process quicker, you can try and create fake supply by creating e.g. fake profiles until your platform gets enough 'real' supply. Just make sure this isn't harmful to the experience of your product.";;Activation;;No;Moderate;No;
83;Bulleted Reassurances;"Bullet points are a useful element as they allow to quickly display the most important points that you want to convey and use little space on the page. They work especially well near points of friction like CTA buttons.
Examples: benefits of your product; reassurances reducing friction such as: no CC required, cancel anytime, full access etc.";;Acquisition Revenue     Referral;copy;No;Low;No;
84;Syndicated Reviews;B2C: Take reviews of the products you sell from manufacturers' websites and use them on your website before you get enough of your own ones.;;Acquisition Revenue;;No;Low;No;
85;Comparison Table vs Competitors;People rarely buy software without doing some research. How can you make their choice easier (in your favor)? Create a table comparing your product to your main competitors. This allows you to clearly pinpoint where your product is superior and making the choice easy for visitors. Tip: put 1 or 2 aspects (of little importance) where your competitors are better - your comparison will seem less subjective. This tactic works well on pricing pages.;;Acquisition Revenue;content competitors;No;Low;Yes;
86;Help Employees Convince Their Boss to Pay for Your Product;"Very often, users who evaluate your product have no purchasing power due to their position at their company. Help them convince their boss to buy your product by providing them with a ready-to-send email copy explaining the benefits that using your product will have on the company's results. That's the end result that they care about in the end.

98;'Done For You' Premium Service;"Offering services alongside your product is a great ""things that don't scale"" strategy to improve the adoption of your product that will help you convert more customers.
As Redpoint Ventures' Tomasz Tunguz says: “At the beginning of a new wave, most customers donʼt understand the technology well. So, they seek experts to guide them. Companies that provide services and education often win the early market. They develop customer relationships, reinforce their expertise with a strong brand, define the purchasing criteria in their favor and ultimately grow faster.”
While his advice is specific to products built in early markets, this strategy can be easily applied to early- stage products looking to gain traction even in established markets.

- if your product is an app builder → offer custom app development services
- web scraping product → create custom scrapers for your users

99;Call to Value, not Call to Action;"As Joanna Wiebe from Copyhackers says: ""A call to value is best for people before theyʼve decided to buy; it reinforces the value of the offering and works toward convincing the prospect.
A call to action is best for people once theyʼve decided to buy; they already understand the value, so itʼs time to stop selling and just make it as frictionless as possible for them to give you their email addy or credit card deets.""";;"Acquisition Activation     Referral Retention

100;Warm Up Email Account;"Every new domain comes with a neutral reputation. It takes time to earn a good or bad reputation.
Domains with bad reputations can be hit with penalties that impact deliverability, which is a huge business risk.
You can improve your new email address' deliverability by 'warming it up'. If you don't do it and start sending emails at scale right away, there's a very high risk of them landing all in spam.
Warming up an email involves a gradual increase in your email sending volume day by day (and ideally getting your emails opened and replied to). You can do this process manually, which involves quite some manual work. But it's better to automate it using a tool like Lemlist that sends and get replies to emails to warm up your email account.

101;What Users Created Using Your Product;Show what your users created using your product to help others easier envision what's possible.

This can be done on a weekly/monthly basis depending on the number of users actively using your product.;;Acquisition Activation Retention;content;No;Moderate;No;
102;Flip the Funnel;"Allow users to experience the product before making them sign up. This way you can get more users to reach the activation point. After they've experienced the value of your product, you'll have an easier job of making them sign up e.g. after a user converts a file and before downloading it.
When does it make sense to test this tactic? When the time it takes to get value is very short and you don't risk that a lot of users will abandon your product before getting value.";;Acquisition Activation;signup;No;High;Yes;

105;Competitor Comparison Pages;"Competitor comparison pages are a great type of content to capture high-intent traffic that is already in the decision-making phase. This is a perfect moment to grab their attention and showcase how your product is superior to competitors. Once you create one such page, you can reuse the page template and easily scale it and produce content comparing your product to other competitors. How to make the most of it:
- focus on competitors' biggest weaknesses (read through review sites to find them)
- if possible, use your positive customer reviews mentioning how users like an aspect where your competitor is lacking
- create a comparison table highlighting where your product is better
- use live chat to be able to answer any uncertainties
visitors may have
And if there is still not enough search traffic for phrases comparing you to your competitors, you can start by creating content comparing two of your competitors and including your product as the third alternative (tactic #291).";;Acquisition;content competitors;No;Moderate;Yes;
106;Negative Opt-Out in Popups;⚠  Approach with caution! ⚠  Most popups have a CTA (or a signup box) and an 'X' to close the popup. Adding a 'no' option will increase the number of users who choose the 'positive' option e.g. 'no, I already have a lot of money' / 'no, my website already gets a ton of traffic'. People will not want to be the ones in the negative scenario and won't be prone to clicking this button. Be super cautious with this tactic as taking this too far will make users feel bad about themselves!;;Acquisition;popup;No;Low;No;
107;Get Leads From Google Sheets/Docs/Slides;⚠  Gray/Black hat tactic ⚠  Post a link to a Google document without making it public -> people will send you an access request -> you'll get an email from Google with their name & email -> just give them the access with a message saying that you forgot to make the document public.;;Acquisition;;No;Low;No;
108;Priming Step;Add an extra step to the beginning of the signup flow explaining why users have to fill it out and what they'll receive in return.

112;Add/Edit Quora Answer Wiki;"Answer wiki is a user-editable summary of all the answers to the question. Its goal is to provide a quick, generally-accepted answer solution rather than reading several lengthy answers. They work best when there are lots of:
different suggestions about the best products, movies, people etc.
lengthy answers all saying the same thing in a different form
Anyone can create an answer wiki but if it's done not objectively or in a clearly promotional way, it will surely be reported and subject to moderation.";;Acquisition;social;No;Low;No;

114;LinkedIn Ad Copy - Targeting Match;"As LinkedIn allows for very precise targeting in their ads, you can match the copy specifically to the audience you're targeting e.g. target CEOs at medical companies and lead the copy with ""CEO at a medical company?"" -> super high relevancy = higher CTRs.";;Acquisition;ads     copy;Yes;Low;No;
115;Reach Older Audiences on Logout Screens;As older people tend to use email services like AOL, Yahoo, MSN etc. and log out after each session, you can reach them there by buying a banner ad placement.

116;Ask Your Users For Content Ideas;Ask your customers what topics are of particular interest to them.

119;Bid on Competitors' Phrases;Bidding on your competitors' brand keywords suggesting users are experiencing issues with their product (e.g. [competitor's name] + help/support/contact etc.) is a great way to get in front of an audience that may be happy to consider other products.

Examples:

125;Content Pruning;Content pruning means removing low-quality content from your website to make your overall SEO performance rise. Why does this work? In short, domain authority is distributed to all your website content. If you remove the low-quality pages, your other ones will get more of the authority and rank higher. Weak content just waters down your website. Follow the attached Hubspot's decision tree for your poorly performing content.;;Acquisition;content;No;Moderate;No;

127;Create a Course;"Create a comprehensive course on a topic related to your business and end it with a certificate awarded for completing an exam.
Make it a go-to destination for people interested in a given topic and establish yourself as an expert in this field. An additional benefit is that after your course becomes a trusted source of information, people will be proud to share their certificates of completion on social media, which will bring new people to the course.";;Acquisition;content;No;High;No;

132;“Four Walls” Copy Technique;"Create an ad that poses four questions to your prospect, with each answer leading logically to the next, until, at the end of your ad, your prospect is all but committed to making the purchase. Not to scare buyers away, but to box them in, cause them to take a stand, and make a request that would demonstrate their commitment to their stand.
E.g. 'Do you enjoy spending hours scouring the web for potential clients? Don't you wish there was a better solution to this? A tool where you'd simply select the criteria and you'd get hundreds of quality contacts in a matter of seconds? How much would your business grow if you had such a tool? Introducing tool X...'

134;Inline Validation;Deliver messages to the user in real-time based on whether the information they entered in a form is correct or incorrect, instead of accumulating all errors and displaying them only after a user clicks the submit button. This greatly improves the user experience. Make sure you don't display an error message before a user has finished typing though - it can be both confusing and annoying.;;Acquisition;signup;No;Moderate;Yes;

140;Segment Facebook Ad Sets by Country Tiers;"Facebook optimizes delivery to bring results at the lowest price possible. Having too many countries in one ad set will usually result in spending most of  your budget in the cheapest countries (where cheapest conversions happen). This way, the more expensive countries in your ad sets won't get enough impressions.
E.g. country tiers:

2. DE, NL, FR
3. CZ, RU, UA";;Acquisition;ads;Yes;Low;No;

142;Link Intersect;Find backlink opportunities using the Ahrefs Link Intersect tool. It shows all websites linking to your competitors but not to you. And if they link to let's say 3 or 4 of them, there's a large chance they'll be open to linking to your website as well.;;Acquisition;seo;Yes;Moderate;No;
143;BuiltWith to Find Leads;"Find companies likely to be your target audience using BuiltWith. Lookup a technology and get all companies that have it implemented on their websites. Example: your product is an alternative to Hotjar - search BuiltWith for Hotjar and download a list of all companies using it (including their estimated tech spend and traffic) -> use this info for cold outreach campaigns using LinkedIn / find emails of relevant people using tools like hunter.io etc.

145;Sticky CTA Bar on Mobile;Fix the CTA button to the bottom of mobile screens to have it handy for visitors so that they don't have to scroll back to the top/bottom of the page.

How to do this:
1) Create a GIF relevant to what your target audience searches for. Include your product/logo/website
2) Upload to Giphy with relevant hashtags
3) Create 5 GIFs and apply for a free channel (this step allows for your GIFs to be publicly searchable)";;Acquisition;;No;Moderate;No;
149;Move Subdomains to Subdirectories;"Get more SEO juice from Google by moving your blog from subdirectory to subdomain i.e. blog.website.com -> website.com/blog
Moz found that by structuring your site with subdomains, you may confuse search engines. Also, you will separate a large portion of keywords under the subdomain and dilute backlink strength.
When does using subdomains make sense? When each subdomain functions as a separate entity within the overall corporation. Disney, for example, has cars.disney.com, videos.disney.com, disneyparks.disney.com, princess.disney.com, and each one serves a very different purpose. Backlinks to each of them won't dilute the topical focus of the site.";;Acquisition;seo;No;Moderate;Yes;
150;Dynamic Keyword Insertion on Landing Page;How the landing page copy matches your ad copy affects your conversion rates. Why? Your ad message sets the expectations that make users click your ad, so if your landing page offer is different than that in the ad, you may lose their trust. That's why dynamic keyword insertion comes handy for your Google Ads campaigns. You can use Google Optimize (or Unbounce's built-in feature) to insert the keyword that triggered your ad into your landing page copy and make it more relevant to visitors.;;Acquisition;ads;No;Moderate;No;
151;Overcoming Ad Blockers for Facebook Ads;"If ad blockers are popular among your target audience (e.g, over 75% millennial gamers use them, while very few mobile users do), you should consider using the static image Facebook pixel instead of the JavaScript one. Ad blockers don't appear to block them.
Here's how to implement this (although it has its limitations): https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook- pixel/advanced#installing-the-pixel-using-an-img- tag";;Acquisition;ads;No;Moderate;Yes;

Don't let others steal your brand traffic.";;Acquisition;content;No;Moderate;No;
154;Retargeting LP with Different Messaging;If you're driving traffic to a custom landing page and users don't convert, you most likely didn't succeed in convincing them with your offer. It makes little sense retargeting them back to the exact same page. Use a landing page with a different value proposition (or a whole new way of explaining your product) to learn if it works better.;;Acquisition;ads;Yes;Moderate;No;
155;Customize Landing Page Based on Referral Source;If you're getting a significant amount of traffic to one of your pages from a given referrer, it makes a lot of sense to treat it like a landing page for paid campaigns - customize it to the traffic source for highest relevance. E.g. traffic coming from Noah Kagan's post -> use Noah Kagan's image and custom copy. Or, a more advanced example: add a section to the referral landing page that pulls stats from the referrerʼs usage of the product: “John, uses product_name X times per week to do Y. Heʼs saved Z hours/dollars using it.” (get an engineer to have the landing page automatically pull this non-sensitive data from the inviterʼs account.);;Acquisition;personalization;No;Moderate;Yes;
156;App Install Ads - Only on Wi-Fi;If your app is over 100MB in size, you can significantly decrease your CPI (cost per install) by targeting only users on Wi-Fi. Those on cellular connection won't be able to install your app anyway as Apple doesn't allow for that anyway. Also, make sure to target only users with the OS versions supporting your app.;;Acquisition;ads;Yes;Low;No;
157;Powered By;If your product is embeddable on other websites (e.g. live chat, search bar, popup, form etc.), have it link back to your site on free plans, inviting people using it to try it out. If your product is not embeddable, make users' websites display your company's widget like e.g. Heap and Mixpanel do it. All these users' active pages will be linking back to your site with a dofollow backlink.;;Acquisition;engineering as …;No;Moderate;Yes;
158;Pre-Qualify Leads at Signup;If your product/service is not targeted at low budget/low traffic customers, it makes sense to increase friction at signup and add questions that will weed them out. E.g. add a website traffic field to your form with an entry point set at a level you believe your leads must have to have a chance to become customers. Lower conversion rate will mean less unqualified leads, thus less wasted time for your sales team.;;Acquisition;signup;No;Low;No;
159;Monopolize Search Ads;If your products are available on other sites, consider sending visitors to them beyond your own site (3 top ads in the screenshots are Casper's too).;;Acquisition;ads;Yes;Moderate;No;
160;Star Ratings in SERP & Google Ads;Improve CTRs from Google search results and ads by implementing star ratings. Reviews = credibility.;;Acquisition;ads;No;Moderate;Yes;
161;Before & After Campaigns;"In a study of 70 campaigns with transparent sales results, Gallup didn't find a single before & after campaign that didnʼt increase sales. They work so well because they use 2 main drivers to persuade people:
1. Pain (people's current state)
2. Desired outcome (where they want to be)
Note that Facebook doesn't allow to use before & after images to promote diet, weight loss, or other health-related products. You are free to use them for all other topics though. E.g. 'Before using tool X, company Y spent 12 hours a week on finding relevant contact info. Now, the whole process is streamlined thanks to tool X and takes just an hour a week. If that employee's time is worth $50/hour that's $550 savings a week and $2200 a month!'";;Acquisition;;No;Moderate;No;
162;Quiz in Exit Intent Popup;"Increase engagement with your exit-intent pop by using a quiz. Ask a couple of questions, then ask for an email to send the result. The highest converting quiz popups are relevant to page content e.g. CXL on blogposts about analytics had a quiz testing visitors their Google Analytics knowledge; on posts about CRO - a CRO knowledge quiz.";;Acquisition;popup;No;Moderate;No;
163;Content Upgrades;Increase the conversion rate from blog readers by offering content upgrades such as ebooks, checklists, cheat sheets, swipe files etc. Display them inside blog content and make sure they're highly relevant to the given blogpost and add extra value to it (e.g. offer extra stuff that was not included in the article).;;Acquisition;content;No;Moderate;No;
164;Signup in a Lightbox;Instead of having a user load a new signup page, load the signup screen in a lightbox. E.g. mixpanel.com does this.;;Acquisition;signup;No;Moderate;Yes;

Requires Zapier premium plan or at least a free 7-day trial.";;Acquisition;;No;Moderate;No;
167;Signup Lightbox Over App View;Let users see what they'll get and how close they are to getting it after they sign up. This should arouse their curiosity and increase motivation to complete the signup process.;;Acquisition;signup;No;Moderate;Yes;
168;Self-Qualification Quiz;Let visitors answer a couple of questions (in a quiz form) about them or their needs and offer your product/service only if they meet the criteria.

169;'See How It Looks on Your Website';Let visitors see how your product would look like on their website. Let them enter their website URL and generate a preview. This not only allows your visitors to easier understand how your product works but also, the endowment effect occurs - people place a greater value on things once they have established ownership. Thus, they are more likely to want to give your product a shot by starting a trial or purchasing a plan. If they don't, you have their website URL and can find their email address this way (just use hunter.io or similar tool).;;Acquisition;engineering as …;No;High;Yes;

171;Concierge Migration;"Offer to migrate the data of users switching to your product from competitors to let them get up to speed quickly, which will improve their retention.
While as much of this process should be automated (see Tactic #292: Data Import in Onboarding), it's not always doable. So it makes sense to offer a manual 'concierge migration' service if the expected LTV of users you provide this service for will be high enough to make it profitable
Example: ConvertKit offers free migrations for users on any paid plan: https://convertkit.com/migrations. They also have 2 migration options depending on how big the users' email list is (which is tied to their expected LTV) - users with larger lists get a more comprehensive service.";;Acquisition;things that don'… competitors;No;High;Yes;

173;Automatic Just-In-Time Webinar;Maximize the percentage of signups who actually attend your webinar by letting users watch it almost instantly. The pre-recorded webinar is available on request and users can select a time that is convenient for them (starts in a couple of minutes). It's also a perfect lead generation tactic to use in exit-intent popups. Tool: https://livestorm.co/;;Acquisition;webinar;Yes;High;No;
174;Merge Two Pieces of Content;Merge two (or more) average-performing pieces of content into one to get more organic traffic. Why does this work? The page authority of merged pages is combined into one. And, the resulting article is more comprehensive as it contains information from multiple articles. Make sure to use a 301 redirect to the 'stronger' article (higher page authority).;;Acquisition;content;No;Moderate;No;
175;Newsjacking;Newsjacking is the art and science of injecting your ideas into a breaking news story so you and your ideas get noticed. If something's just been made popular, there will be lots of people searching for that topic. Product content on that topic to get it in front of these people, plus generate backlinks to your site.;;Acquisition;content;No;High;No;
176;Decrease Page Loadtime;Obvious but very often forgotten. This tactic is hugely effective and always works. Higher conversion rates. Better SEO. Better UX.;;Acquisition;;No;Moderate;Yes;
177;Boost Your Article to the Top of Any Major Publication;"Online publications such as Forbes, Inc. etc. put their most popular content on top of their homepage making it seen by even more visitors. How to get there if you succeed in having your article published by one of these publishers?
Step 1 - create a Twitter post with a link to your article. We want to drive traffic to our article through a link from an organic source so that the publication doesn't suspect anything.
Step 2 - this one's crucial - grab the t.co link that
Twitter automatically shortens your proper link to Step 3 - run ads driving cheap traffic to your article via the shortened link. How to get the cheapest link clicks e.g. from Facebook? Target the whole Facebook network without any narrowing and optimize for link clicks (of course) - Facebook will get you the cheapest clicks possible.";;Acquisition;;Yes;Moderate;No;
178;Don't Make Forms Look Like Forms;People don't like filling out forms. Make them look like they're not forms whenever possible. Use large, clickable images and toggle sliders to make filling them out more fun for users.;;Acquisition;signup;No;Moderate;Yes;
179;Upfront Progress;People feel a higher need to complete a task as it gets closer to completion. That's why some coffee shops give away pre-stamped cards with two stamps instead of one. On the Internet, show the progress users have already made as e.g. a crossed-out item on the onboarding checklist, 50% complete bar on the popup after only having clicked it etc. Just make sure that users feel the progress as soon as possible.;;Acquisition;signup onboarding;No;Low;Yes;
180;Social Proof Next to Friction Point;"Placing a social proof element next to a point of friction decreases psychological resistance that your visitors experience when trying to complete an action. E.g. forms, CTA buttons etc.
Examples of social proof:
- customer logos
- number of users
- testimonial
- awards/certifications
- press mentions
- ratings from App Stores / user review sites like Capterra";;Acquisition;social proof;No;Low;Yes;
181;Prominent Contact Information;Put your company phone number (and email) at the top of the page so visitors know they can easily reach you if they need any help. It also makes you more trustworthy as you don't seem like you try to avoid contact with visitors.;;Acquisition;;No;Low;Yes;
182;Contact Unhappy Competitors' Users;Reach out to unhappy users that leave negative feedback about competing products on review sites like G2, Capterra etc. They'll be more than happy to hear about a better solution to their need that wasn't satisfied by the competing product. You can even go a step further and monitor the review sites for new, negative reviews using a tool like visualping.io;;Acquisition;things that don'…;No;Moderate;No;
183;Breadcrumb Technique;"Removing as many form fields as possible leaves users with just the most intimidating ones to fill - personal info. So the goal of the breadcrumb technique is to get the visitor to micro-convert before asking for contact info. How? By asking questions that are easy to answer and let them stay anonymous. E.g. a growth agency may ask prospects about the funnel step that is of highest priority for them at the moment; a software dev shop may ask what is the scope of the project - mobile/web/both (these answers don't even have to be useful to you). Note: this tactic only works for big asks, e.g. quotes (not stuff like ebook downloads). For best results  use dropdowns or radio buttons to make it as easy  as possible to answer.";;Acquisition;signup;No;Low;Yes;
184;Re-post Website Content on Medium;Republish your content on Medium for extra exposure to a new audience. There won't be any duplicate content issues as you will get a canonical link from Medium.

188;Cold Email Invitation;Send a cold email pretending to be an invitation to a community/social network site. Aroused curiosity will make people prone to click and check your product.;;Acquisition;email;No;Low;No;
189;Sequential Campaigns;Show a series of ads to a particular user, in a specific order, for a specific number of days. If a user converts, he's excluded from the rest of the sequence. Use each ad to show a different feature/use case/USP of your product. E.g. user visited a landing page but didn't sign up for a free trial. Set up a Facebook campaign consisting of 4  ads that will be shown one after another, for 3 days each. Each ad will need a custom audience made up with LP visitors from last x days e.g. 1st ad: last 3 days, 2nd ad: last 6 days with last 3 days excluded, 3rd ad: last 9 days with last 6 days excluded, and so on.;;Acquisition;ads;Yes;Moderate;No;
190;Progress Bar on Signup;Show users how close they are to completing the signup process by using a progress bar. Completion bias is apparent here - people feel the need to finish what they started.;;Acquisition;signup;No;Moderate;Yes;
191;Skyscraper Technique;"Skyscraper is a tactic created by Brian Dean (Backlinko). As he himself describes it:
Step 1: Find link-worthy content
Step 2: Make something even better Step 3: Reach out to the right people
Create content that's better than everything else what's already been produced on a given topic and capture the backlinks from sites linking to them.";;Acquisition;content;No;Moderate;No;
192;Add secondary CTA;Some users may want to talk first.;;Acquisition;;No;Low;Yes;
193;Multi-Step Forms;Split your long forms into multiple steps to make it feel less daunting to complete. This tactic can have an especially large impact on mobile devices.;;Acquisition;signup;No;Moderate;Yes;
194;Anti-Ad Copy;"Tell users *not* to buy your product. Stand out from all other advertisers who talk about how great their product is. E.g. ""Grammarly? But I no how to right correclty.""";;Acquisition;ads     copy;No;Low;No;
195;Testimonial Carousel Ads;Testimonials and case studies are the perfect type of content for retargeting ads - when users are familiar with your product and just need that little push to convert. Carousels are a perfect ad format to showcase them e.g. each carousel card shows a case study from a different industry.;;Acquisition;ads;Yes;Low;No;
196;Don't Hide Short Forms Behind Buttons;The problem with hiding short forms is that visitors can't see how easy they would be to fill out. So, instead of hiding them, place them directly on your pages.;;Acquisition;signup;No;Low;Yes;
197;Decrease Time to Interactive;"The Time to Interactive (TTI) metric measures how long it takes a page to become interactive. Site performance is a ranking factor for search and TTI is one of the most key factors. Various tools' (e.g.
Intercom, Segment, Hotjar) scripts, load in the background and delay TTI. How to decrease TTI and improve site performance:
1) Load the page with no heavy scripts
2) Wait for a scroll event
3) Wait a further second
4) Then load all the heavy scripts
Code snippet to delay script firing: window.addEventListener('scroll', () => setTimeout(()

// load your scripts here
}, 1000),
{ once: true}
);";;Acquisition;;No;Moderate;Yes;
198;Leverage New Platform Features;This is a rather general tip. When a social network introduces a new feature (e.g. Facebook Live, LinkedIn's embedded slides), it will increase the reach of posts using these features in order to drive adoption. Don't miss out and always test the new features.;;Acquisition;social;No;Moderate;No;
199;Dimmed Product Background on Signup;"To increase the % of signup form submissions, place the form on top of a dimmed product screenshot.
This will communicate that the end goal is just one click (or form submission) away.";;Acquisition;signup;No;Moderate;Yes;
200;Update Old Content;"Update your old blog content and distribute it again. An extra benefit is that you'll get higher organic CTRs - as Google will display the new published date in SERP (if the content is updated in at least 10%).
Plus, Google likes fresh content so it should get a little SEO boost.";;Acquisition;content;No;Moderate;No;
201;Gated Videos;Use a tool like Wistia to collect leads from your video content. You can either gate the video completely by making the email box required to fill in order to watch the video. Or put the email gate in the middle and offer to sign up to get notified with new content.;;Acquisition;;No;Low;No;
202;Native Ads That Don't Look Like Native Ads;"Use banners that look like elements of your website
e.g. a search box, making users more likely to click them. Make sure to drive them to a page where they can easily continue performing this action for good user experience.
NOTE: such banners will be disapproved on GDN
because they 'mimic a function the ad canʼt perform'.";;Acquisition;ads;Yes;Low;No;

204;Retarget Users Based on Enriched Data;Use Clearbit Reveal to create retargeting audiences from your website based on e.g. company industry, tech stack, job role, seniority etc. This way you'll be able to run hyper-targeted ads.;;Acquisition;ads personalization;Yes;Moderate;Yes;
205;Email Validation in Forms;Use e.g. Zerobounce API to disallow invalid and temporary emails from your forms.;;Acquisition;signup;No;Moderate;Yes;
206;Align Search Intent to Content Upgrades;Use Google Search Console to find the phrases users searched for to find your page. Then gather their contact info by offering content upgrades (PDF downloads) closely related to what they exactly needed. This is a sure way to get higher conversion rates than a generic CTA or newsletter subscription would get.;;Acquisition;content;No;Moderate;No;
207;Personalized Images, Videos and Landing Pages;Use Lemlist to send outreach emails with personalized images and drive traffic to personalized landing pages with copy, images and videos custom to visitor's company.

210;Retarget Expensive Traffic on Cheaper Channel;Use the ad platform that allows for the most precise targeting for prospecting. Then retarget this highly targeted traffic using a cheaper channel.;;Acquisition;ads;Yes;Moderate;No;
211;Content Repurposing;Use the content you already have and reach more people by distributing it on new channels. Turn your best performing text content into video/audio/slides/infographics and vice versa.;;Acquisition;content;No;Moderate;No;
212;Review Mining;Use your most satisfied customers' expressions in your copy. Go to a website where you keep your users' reviews and copy some of the best-written phrases they used to describe your product. Your users will often have a better opinion on what your product is for them.;;Acquisition;copy;No;Moderate;No;
213;Old Content Syndication;Use your old blog content that didn't get traction on your blog and offer it as guest posts to other websites. Of course, it has to still be relevant and written by your company's employee. Follow the attached content pruning decision tree by Hubspot.;;Acquisition;content;No;Moderate;No;
214;Switch the Slogan and Tagline;Very often companies use their slogan as h1 text in their hero section and the actual headline as h2. A slogan usually doesn't help in explaining the product/service well, so it's best to either move it to h2 or not use it in the hero at all. It can be placed e.g. beneath the logo.;;Acquisition;copy;No;Low;No;
215;Reach Journalists with Facebook/Twitter Ads;Very often, journalists may be hard to reach by email. Try to target them with Facebook (by job title) or Twitter (by handle) ads instead.;;Acquisition;ads;Yes;Moderate;No;
216;Move Difficult Signup Steps to the End;Weight of first form fields - make first form fields easiest to fill. Move riskiest, highest friction signup/form steps to the end of the flow to improve completion rates. The cognitive bias behind this tactic is called completion bias - people feel compelled to complete a task once they have started it. Human brain specifically seeks the pleasure completing a task brings.;;Acquisition;signup;No;Low;No;
217;Problem-Solving Content;What are the tools you use in relation to your niche? What issues users may have related to them that you can write explanations about? By writing helpful content about them you'll get incredibly targeted traffic and show your expertise in a given field.;;Acquisition;content;No;Moderate;No;
218;Remove Slider/Carousel from Hero Section;"Whatʼs wrong with using carousels in the hero section? First, the human eye reacts to movement, and carousels distract us from the one main thing you should convey in the hero. Also, too many messages equals no message. This is known as the clutter effect. And third, they look like banners, which people ignore because they mistake them for ads and generally hate them (banner blindness).
When can hero carousels work though? Ecommerce and travel sites are good examples as they don't want to show only one product/offer.";;Acquisition;;No;Low;Yes;
219;Dimmed Background on Form Fill;When a user starts filling out a form, dim the rest of the page to get their 100% focus on submitting the form.;;Acquisition;signup;No;Low;Yes;

222;Buy Domain for SEO;"When starting out with a new domain, it's hard to get decent traffic from SEO as your domain authority is 0.
How to speed this up - find another domain (expired or existing) in the same niche as yours and 301 redirect it to your current domain. Your website will inherit all the links and anchor text that the previous site had.
Make sure the new site has a decent Topical Trust Flow similar (topics similar to yours), un-optimized anchor text, and was not used for spam in the past, among others.";;Acquisition;seo;Yes;High;No;
223;Get Multiple Backlinks by Sponsoring a Podcast;You can sponsor a podcast solely for the goal of getting backlinks: from the podcast website + from podcast hosting services (e.g. libsyn), which are high DR do-follow backlinks.;;Acquisition;seo;Yes;Moderate;No;
224;Accelerated Retargeting;"Increase the performance of your retargeting ad campaigns by adjusting the frequency over time.
The more time passes after someone visited your site, the less likely they are to click on your retargeting ad. How can you take advantage of this fact and optimize your retargeting campaign?
Split your campaign into 2-3 ad groups based on the time passed since users visited your site e.g.:
- ad group 1: high frequency, 2-3x/day for the first week after visit
- ad group 2: lower frequency: 1x/day for the next 1 week
- ad group 3: occasional: 1x/every 2-3 weeks
Remember to always take your average time to close a deal into consideration when setting retargeting frequency.";;Acquisition;ads;Yes;Moderate;No;
225;Exchange Facebook Pixel Data;"To reach new Facebook audiences with your ads, you can exchange your pixel data with other advertisers. If there is a company that you know has a similar audience to you but is not a direct competitor, this could be a worthwhile tactic for both of you.
There are a couple of ways to do that:
- share the whole pixel data (details: https://www.facebook.com/business/help/27905999 6069252?id=2042840805783715)
- share an audience (details: https://www.facebook.com/business/help/49929066 3823687?id=2469097953376494)

226;Content Targeted at Users in Transition;New products are often adopted during periods of transition. Decision-makers starting new roles, end and beginning of budgeting periods, entering a new market, launching a new product etc. Having content targeted at readers in transition helps you convert users with potentially high intent and open to trying new products.;;Acquisition;content;No;Moderate;No;
227;Bundles;Leverage the audience of other, complementary products (not competing ones) and offer your product bundled with theirs at a discounted price. This allows you to reach a potentially very valuable audience at a low cost. Some examples where this tactic would work well include: newsletters (e.g. https://divinations.substack.com/p/introducing-the- divinations-superorganizers), media sites subscriptions, productivity apps, tools that make up one stack e.g. website builder and no-code membership software.;;Acquisition;co-marketing;No;Moderate;Yes;
228;Integrate with Other Products;"Building integrations with other products is a great way of accessing their user bases. Especially when integrating with a more established product.
The goal here is to improve their users' experience by offering features that the other product doesn't have. When searching for such partnership opportunities, look for features that your customers would find valuable but you're not looking to develop in the near future. The integration has to be beneficial for both parties, as well as more valuable for users than if they were to use the two products independently.
Aspects to consider when evaluating potential partners:
- audience fit: how useful your product will be to
your partner's audience
- potential: how large is their user base
- ease of implementation
Well-known examples include Stripe & Shopify, PayPal & eBay.";;Acquisition;co-marketing;No;High;Yes;
229;Family Plan/User Bundling;"E-commerce companies use product bundling. Subscription companies use user bundling.
Examples: Spotify, Headspace, or 1Password offering family plans, MasterClass' 1+1 offer.
Combine multiple users into one plan at a single price. The benefit for users is lower subscription price. The benefit for companies is users inviting their friends or families and subscribing to one premium plan. Ideally, you should be able to retain these users longer thanks to the social aspect of the offer - they'll exchange their experiences (MasterClass, Headspace) or compete (if e.g.
MyFitnessPal were to offer such plan), which will make them more engaged with the product.";;Acquisition Referral;pricing;No;Moderate;Yes;
230;Leads from Freelance Sites;"Sites like Upwork and Freelancer can be good sources of leads, especially in the early stages of growing your project.
Start by manually looking for:
a) job offers that indicate the job poster might find your product helpful
b) contractors looking for work where your tool could
be of use to them.
Contact job posters by applying to relevant jobs and introducing your product. Contact job seekers by contacting them directly.
If this approach works, you can scale this tactic by using a website monitoring tool that will notify you anytime a specific keyword or phrase is mentioned.";;Acquisition;things that don'…;No;Moderate;No;
231;Geo Rollout;When launching a new product, roll it out on all ad platforms one location/area at a time instead of spreading your ad budget thin. It will allow you to create an impression that your company is bigger than it really is because people will see your ads everywhere. This should be a more efficient way of spending your ad budget.;;Acquisition;ads;Yes;Moderate;No;
232;Influencers Niche Rollout;Sponsor multiple influencers from the same niche at the same time. This will create an impression that your company is bigger than it really is because 'everyone' in your industry is talking about your product.;;Acquisition;;Yes;Moderate;No;
233;Partner with Course Creators;"Reach new audiences by partnering with course creators.
Find courses that are relevant to your product on sites like Udemy, Skillshare etc. and offer creators an affiliate deal. Share with them revenue from every lead/sale they bring. To make it more effective, give a special offer to students as well.";;Acquisition;co-marketing;No;Moderate;No;
234;Pre-Targeting Before Cold Outreach;"How to make your outreach strategy more effective with pre-targeting.
1. Create a custom audience made up with your target accounts - best ad platforms for this are LinkedIn and Twitter as they allow for the most precise targeting (LinkedIn by company name and Twitter by user's handle) - you can even use them both at the same time
2. Run ads targeted at these audiences to build initial brand awareness (optimize for reach)
3. Only after your target audience has been seeing your ads for a couple of days/weeks, start your outreach campaign
Why does it work? Mere exposure effect - people prefer things they're familiar with. When you reach out to them after the pre-targeting campaign, your company is no longer unknown to them.";;Acquisition;ads;Yes;Moderate;No;
235;Buyer's Guide;"When users do extensive research before making a purchase (think B2B and higher-ticket B2C products), you should help them make a decision. A comprehensive buyer's guide will let you capture and convert these high intent audiences.
Answer all the questions a potential buyer may have when looking around for the best solution for their needs. Also, try making it sound as objective as possible as being too salesy will immediately make you lose your credibility.";;Acquisition;content;No;Moderate;No;
236;Playbooks;"Help your prospects understand how to make the most out of your product/service by creating playbooks containing specific tactics for using your product.
If your product is meant to be used by different teams within a company, create a separate playbook for each of them.
This type of content works well not only for lead gen but also in later stages of the funnel, helping users get more value from the product and retain better.
Good examples are Clearbit's playbooks for sales and marketing:

237;Campaign Performance Feedback;"We all know that the more value a user gets out of your product, the more likely she is to keep using it for a long time. We also know that humans learn best when they get feedback on the actions they take.
How can we use this knowledge to improve the
activation and retention of our products?
Give performance feedback on users' campaigns.
Good examples include HubSpot's Email Health tool and SEMrush's Site Audit tips (see screenshots).
They do a couple of things:
1. Explain what a metric means and why it's important
2. Tell users if their performance is good or bad
3. Give tips on how they can do better
In the early stages of growing your product it also makes sense to offer your help and get on a call to discuss users' results.";;Activation Retention;;No;Moderate;Yes;
238;Automate Your Outbound Based on G2 Traffic;"G2's premium plan allows you to see who viewed either your or your competitors' review page and how many pages they viewed in total. This gives you super valuable intel on high-intent leads. With this tactic you can automate the outreach process.
Overview of the process:
1. Get lead data from G2
2. Score leads with MadKudu
3. Check if a lead is in your CRM
4. Find a relevant contact
5. Send an email automatically
This tactic requires a couple $k a month budget (for G2 paid plan, MadKudu, and Clearbit), so only makes sense if your deal size is large enough.

239;Instant Qualification in Subheadline;Instantly qualify your website visitors by saying who uses your product in the subheadline e.g. 'Loved by bootstrapped SaaS makers' or 'Enterprise sales reps save hours a week with [your product name]'. This gives your visitors an immediate confirmation that they're in the right place to solve their problem.;;Acquisition;copy;No;Low;No;
240;Personalized Onboarding Videos;"Send custom onboarding videos to your customers (or even trial users if can manage it) to take personalization to the next level.
Do some quick research on them and give some personalized tips based on their tech stack, technographic/demographic data, or any other data point, and make them feel like they're not 'just another number'.
Here's an example welcome video ConvertKit used to send to their customers: https://www.bonjoro.com/g/h5KUfm_aDgJ

241;Recover Failed Payments;"Reduce involuntary churn by sending automated messages to customers whose payments didn't go through.
The vast majority of credit cards expire every 36 months, which means about 2.8% of your customers' cards will expire every month. This can lead to over 30% of revenue loss from annual subscriptions every year. The longer your plans are, the higher the chance of CC expirations preventing successful billing.
Another reason for failed payments can be mechanical failures of your tools. Make sure to review the connection points between your merchant provider, bank, and payment processor to alleviate any issues. These types of issues should be easy to avoid.
How to make the renewal emails as efficient as possible:
- remind your customers of the value they've been
getting from your product - include any reports and stats if you can so your request for new payment is justified
- reduce friction as much as possible - include a custom link driving users straight to the payment update page with pre-populated fields
Tools:

243;Leverage Other People's Networks;"I wrote a whole post with multiple tactics about it: https://www.getscrapbook.com/blog/other-peoples- networks
If you're launching a new product and don't have an existing audience, or if you just want to reach a new, relevant audience, then using other people's networks might be an appealing strategy.
The concept comes from finance, where ""other people's money"" refers to gaining financial leverage by using borrowed capital from banks to increase one's potential returns.
Marketers use this approach to tap into other people's or companies' audiences to get exposure in a relatively cheap way.
In finance, this strategy is a double-edged sword. If an investment levered with other peopleʼs money turns out to be profitable, then the profits are magnified by the effects of the leverage. If it goes wrong, then the losses are amplified by the use of other people's money.
In marketing, if you choose your target right, there's only upside to this approach.";;Acquisition;;No;Moderate;No;
244;Invite Well-networked Guests on Your Podcast or Webinar;"Using the fact that people share what they're up to on their social channels, you can make them share your content if you invite them on your podcast, webinar, or interview.
Lemlist has been using this strategy with success, hosting webinars with people such as Rand Fishkin, Aaron Ross, or Tim Soulo. They're not only providing great value for their own users but also exposing Lemlist's brand to their target audience at low cost.
And their guests help them with promoting this content.
If you don't run a podcast or webinars and don't plan to, you can get featured on someone else's. Reach out to relevant hosts and offer your input making sure it's aligned with their audience's interests.";;Acquisition;"content webinar

246;Target Facebook Groups Members;"While it's not possible to target Facebook group members with ads directly through ads manager, there are two workarounds:
#1
Join the group you want to target
Using your business page, create a video that's relevant and valuable to the group audience
Share the video in the group (go to video -> share -> share in a group) (from your personal account) Create a custom audience of people that interacted with it
Target the custom audience with ads
#2
Contact the group admin and ask if they're willing to sell access to any of the custom audiences they've built based on their group members. Here's how it can be done: https://www.facebook.com/business/help/49929066

247;Intent Data for Churn Prevention;"If your customers start reading reviews of your competitors, thereʼs a high chance theyʼre at a churn risk.
But you can prevent it.
Premium version of G2 lets you upload a list of your customers and get notified whenever any of them starts researching other solutions in your space.
What can you do to retain them? Reach out as soon as possible and learn why theyʼre unsatisfied with your product. Then do what needs to be done so that they get the value they expected when choosing your solution – help them with setup or offer extra training.";;Retention;;Yes;Moderate;No;
248;Interactive Blogpost Quizzes;"Convert more leads from your blogposts by embedding interactive quizzes.
Example: In their article on churn reduction https://paddle.com/blog/reduce-churn Paddle uses relevant quizzes (created with Typeform) to test visitors on how their churn prevention efforts perform. First, they ask them what measures they take to reduce churn at their companies. Then, they collect their business metrics such as MMR, growth and churn rate. And lastly, they collect users' emails so they can send them a report with a score based on their inputs. Of course, there's also a CTA to check out Paddle's churn reduction features.
They use all the data users provide to qualify leads and move them down the funnel.";;Acquisition;content;No;Moderate;No;
249;Personal Campaign Review;"Help users make the most of your product by offering them personal campaign reviews. Have a person e.g. from your CS team analyze a customer's campaign and record a quick video pinpointing the improvements they can make to improve the performance of their campaign.
Better results mean satisfied users, and satisfied users mean higher retention. They'll appreciate the personal touch from your team as well.";;Activation Retention;things that don'…;No;Moderate;No;

252;Offboarding Flow;"Add offboarding to your cancellation process to save some of the churning users and collect qualitative feedback from the rest.
This is one of the few cases where adding (a little) friction is actually a good thing.
Users signed up to your product for a reason - remind them of the value theyʼll lose (data, history, etc.) if they cancel their account (loss aversion).
Then, ask what's the reason they're leaving. Based on their answer, you can offer them a salvage offer and try to retain them.
Some example offers you can make to make them stay:
- Downgrade to a lower pricing plan - if price is the
reason
- Let them pause their account - if price is the reason
- Offer extra training to help them get more value out
of the product - if they didn't get the value they expected
Even if you fail to make them stay, such offboarding flow will let you collect some valuable feedback that will help you make the experience better for other users.

- have a downward product usage trend
- submitted one or two negative NPS scores
- start researching your competitors on G2 (premium plan allows this)
What can you do to retain them? Reach out as soon as possible and learn why they're unsatisfied with your product. Then do what needs to be done so that they get the value they expected when choosing your solution - help them with setup or offer extra training.

255;Templates;"Give users a warm start and get them up to speed by offering templates for the most common use cases of your product.
Examples include survey templates by SurveyMonkey, email templates by MailChimp, base templates by Airtable etc.
Templates let users get to core product value quicker, increasing the % of users who will be activated.
Also, on the acquisition side, there's potential to rank for template-related phrases in search results.
SurveyMonkey ranks for phrases like questionnaire template, customer survey template, hiring questionnaire template etc.
To make the most out of this traffic, make sure after signing up users land on the selected template so that the experience is highly aligned with what they came for.
How to take this tactic further: create a marketplace for templates, like e.g. Webflow did. This way, users who need templates have a large choice, and the opportunity to get free exposure to Webflow's large user base attracts template creators (designers and agencies) who have a chance to show off their skills and get new business.

256;Using Negative Reviews to Your Advantage;"Turn haters into promoters. Take quotes from some of your negative reviews and use them in your marketing campaigns.
The key is to pick the reviews left by users who are clearly not your target audience.

Nothing could be more enticing to their target audience than this.";;Acquisition;ads     copy;No;Moderate;No;

258;Bid on Competitors' YouTube Videos;"Grab the attention of users watching YouTube videos about your competitors using in-stream ads.
Google lets you hyper-target your ads to specific videos, which makes it a perfect opportunity to capture some of your competitors' potential or existing users.
With in-stream ads, you can show your ad before, during, or after your competitor's video.
There are two types of in-stream ads you can choose from:
- Skippable ads - after 5 seconds, the viewer can skip the ad, so it's crucial that you make the beginning engaging enough that users will continue to watch it past the 5 seconds point. The cool thing about this ad type is that you only pay when a viewer watches at least 30 seconds of your video (or the full duration of the video if it's shorter than 30 seconds) or interacts with your video, whichever comes first.
- Non-skippable ads - users don't have an option to skip the ad, but you pay for all impressions it gets.
To capture even more real estate with your ads, you can reach users at an earlier step - when they're searching for a video. Using video discovery ads, your banners will show up on YouTube search results pages. Clicking the ad will drive users to your video.";;Acquisition;ads competitors video;Yes;Low;No;
;;;;;;;;;
259;Expert Marketplace;"Help users get more value out of your product by matching them with vetted experts. In other cases, reduce the barrier to entry for users with not enough skills or time.
Create a directory of verified freelancers/consultants who will help your users get up to speed with your product, make them use it more efficiently, or even do all the work themselves.
Let users either browse through the directory or create a request and let experts apply.
Some expert marketplace examples: https://experts.shopify.com/ https://experts.webflow.com/ https://www.livechat.com/marketplace/experts/ https://www.thinkific.com/experts/ https://bubble.io/agencies https://www.mural.co/playmakers https://www.squarespace.com/designer/home";;Activation Retention;;No;Moderate;Yes;
260;Eliminate Dead Ends;"Activate more users by removing any dead end experiences and making sure there's always an obvious next step for users to take.
Before activating a user, your goal is to help him take the core action that leads to establishing a habit.
Dead ends kill users' momentum and decrease the
chance of taking that action.
Always think of how completing one product flow can lead to another feature or use case.

261;Buying Out Competitors' Contracts;"If you have enough runway and are looking to aggressively gain market share, offer to buy out contracts from your competitors' customers. You'll have to sacrifice your ACV (annual contract value) but you'll gain valuable customers already using the solution you're offering.
How it works is:
1. Users apply and get verified that they're under a contract with the competitor(s) you specify
2. The remaining value of their subscription is applied as a credit to their account they create with you
3. They're using your product for free until their contract with your competitor runs out (you should decide how long they have to commit to subscribing to your product)

262;Align Referral Incentives with User Motivation;"Referral incentives are most effective when they're in line with the user's motivation to use your product.
So don't blindly offer financial incentives because that's what most companies do. Always try to align them with what matters most to your users.
Examples:
- File storage product offering more space
- Mobile game offering in-app items
- Investing app offering money";;Referral;;No;Moderate;Yes;
263;Altruistic Referrals;"Increase the number of referrals made by your users by focusing the reward on the invitee. Humans are more selfless than we tend to think.
So, instead of saying 'Get 1 month free for inviting a friend', say 'Send your friend a 1-month free access (and get 1 month free yourself)'. The second part is optional - test if a one-sided incentive will be enough so you don't unnecessarily reduce your LTV.
Some important points to keep in mind to make your referral program effective:
- Incentivize sharing after a successful action, when user psych is high
- Reduce the friction of searching for friends' emails by using a contact picker that integrates with your address book e.g. using cloudsponge.com
- Reduce friction further by auto-generating a referral email, so your users just need to confirm it. Also, make the default message sound like it's coming from a user and not the brand.
Here's how you can hack together an MVP referral program if you're just starting out with this channel: https://medium.com/startup-grind/how-to-hack- together-a-referral-program-in-less-than-1-hour- 5ebfff5a725a";;Referral;;No;Moderate;Yes;
264;Compare Prices to Users' Current Situation;"Add an extra (fake) tier to your pricing table reminding users how much they're currently paying instead of using your product (and saving).
This tactic uses the principle of price anchoring with a slight twist. Price anchoring means establishing a price point that users can refer to when making decisions. Commonly used examples include discounts (where the original price is the anchor) and SaaS pricing tables where one plan is much more expensive than the other ones.
The larger the difference between available options, the easier the choice.
Teamflow, a virtual office software is using the average cost of renting an office as the anchor. This way, the price of their product seems negligible relative to the office rent cost ($15-25 vs $799).

265;Demo Experiences;"Convert and activate more users by letting them demo your product before signing up.
If the time to get value from your product is short and you're able to show its capabilities right away, it makes sense to reduce this time further by moving the signup to a later step. And the sooner users experience the value, the higher the probability they will retain.
Examples:

266;Match CTA Copy to Blogpost Content;"Increase the number of signups from your blog by matching the call-to-action copy to blogpost content.
Use specific, contextual CTAs within your content instead of generic ones across the whole blog. This makes readers more confident that your product solves the exact challenge they came to read about thus making them more likely to convert.";;Acquisition;content     copy;No;Low;No;
267;Before and After Pages;"Instead of a standard (and very often boring) customer testimonials page, create a before and after page showing how your customers' business or life changed thanks to using your product.
Multiple benefits of such pages:
- They're quicker to read and grasp the difference a product makes than reading a long case study
- They're more compelling as they don't just show the benefit but the transformation of users which is easier for users to imagine
- They're easier to collect - customers don't need to spend an hour filling long testimonial questionnaires or going on calls

268;Show Savings from All-In-One Products;"All-in-one products can make their prices be perceived as more reasonable by displaying on the pricing page all the products that they make redundant.
Show example tools (and their prices) that your product replaces so that users can clearly see the savings associated with choosing it. When they'll be aware of it, your pricing will become more attractive.";;Acquisition;content pricing;No;Low;Yes;
269;Honest Trial Paywall;"When users cancel their subscription right after starting the free trial, it's often because they don't want to forget about the end of it and accidentally get charged.
Reduce the anxiety related to subscribing by being transparent and explicitly showing what will happen during the trial. Most importantly, that you'll remind users about their trial coming to an end.
This will help you gain trust and reduce the number of complaints from users who didn't plan on extending their subscription past the free trial.
Of course, don't blindly use this tactic without doing proper user research and learning the main cause of cancellations.
Here's a great case study on how Blinkist used this tactic to increase their trial signups (+23%), reduce user complaints (-55%), and greatly increase push notification opt-ins (from 6% to 74%, crazy!): https://uxplanet.org/how-solving-our-biggest- customer-complaint-at-blinkist-led-to-a-23- increase-in-conversion-b60ad514134b";;Acquisition Retention;signup;No;Moderate;Yes;
270;Intent Data for Cold Outreach;"Intent data is all the behavioral signals indicating that a company is underway the buying cycle.
Some very useful sources of such signals come from tech changes, new job openings, new hires, funding announcements, new partnerships, product launches, awards, expansions to new markets, etc.
Some examples of how these signals can be used in cold outreach:
New job openings. A company hiring in a given department is a sign it's in a good position to invest more in this area of its business. This creates an outreach opportunity for products from that field (job descriptions offer extra insights on the specifics).
New hires. After a person switches jobs, they're likely to introduce new products into their new company - either adopting new ones or replacing existing ones because of personal preference (especially if they're in leadership roles).
Tech changes. Dropping a product from a company's stack opens up the opportunity for a
replacement. There's a chance they weren't satisfied with their previous solution and are willing to try another one. Adopting a new piece of software is a signal that a company may need a complimentary one. Based on your technographic research of your customers, find out what other software your product is most often used together with.
Product launches. Launching a new product means that a company is looking to grow its market share in that area. If your product can facilitate that, there's a chance they'll need it. Researching other products. Premium plan of G2 (starts at about $10k/year) lets you see which companies visited either your product listing, competitors' listings, or a given product category page.

271;Usage Cap on Lower Pricing Tiers;"Add a usage limit to your free or lower-priced tiers so that users can naturally upgrade their subscription after experiencing value from your product.
Examples include Zoom's 40-minute call limit on their free plan or DocuSign's 5 docs/month limit on their lowest paid plan.
This tactic is one of the components of creating a high-performing value-based pricing strategy (charging based on the value users are getting rather than based on features).";;Revenue;pricing;No;Moderate;Yes;
272;Ungate Features That Drive Collaboration and Engagement;"Put the features that drive engagement and collaboration in your free plan to fuel your product's acquisition and expansion revenue.
Examples of such features include sharing (great for driving casual contact viral loops) and integrations with internally used products such as Slack (great for pulling more team members into the product).
To make it easier to understand the potential impact of this tactic, imagine if Miro or Figma gated their sharing features.";;Revenue;pricing;No;Moderate;Yes;
273;New Feature Trials;"Increase the % of users who get activated and upgrade their plans by offering your newly-launched features to all userbase as a free trial.
How this tactic can affect different types of users: For dormant and non-activated users, you're creating another chance for getting them activated.
For activated users, it's an opportunity to get them hooked on a higher plan's value. By having access to the new feature for a limited time, they can see what they're missing out on if they don't upgrade.";;Activation Revenue;;No;Moderate;Yes;
274;Linkbuilding with Search Ads;"Scale your backlink acquisition efforts by running search ads to your link-worthy content (stats and original research, expert quotes, infographics etc.).
Ahrefs came up with the concept of 'vicious circle of SEO' which says that:
1.  People search for something and read the #1 result
2.  Some of them link to that content
3.  Thanks to these backlinks, the page stays at the top of the search results
...and the loop repeats.
Which led to the idea that paying for the exposition at the top of SERP may be a viable source of new backlinks.
Main benefits:
May be cheaper than manual outreach Mostly passive (you'll still need to manually analyze the attribution by checking which of
the newly acquired backlinks contain the 'gclid' parameter)
Side benefit:
Some of the traffic will perform other actions such as trial and newsletter signups which will further increase the campaign ROI
Challenge:
Attribution - only some % of backlinks will be directly attributable to your search campaign

;;;;;;;;;
275;Use Case Transition;"Accelerate habit formation by adding new use cases to your product.
Products with infrequent use cases (e.g. yearly) are in danger of being forgotten about when the next chance to use them happens. Such companies end up re-acquiring users, which is expensive.
The solution to this problem is adding more use cases around your product to stay top of mind of users.
For example, a user sending yearly customer satisfaction surveys using SurveyMonkey is likely to forget about the product next time she needs to run a survey and may choose a competitor. To stay top of mind, SurveyMonkey transitions users to weekly/monthly customer research surveys which helps build a habit.
Adding new use cases is not cheap. Often requires creating a whole new product or a lot of user education. But for the long-term growth of products with infrequent use cases, adding another use case is very often necessary.
Other examples from companies that solved this challenge successfully:
Zillow - main use case: buying home (yearly+ frequency) → new use case: Zestimate score (monthly frequency)
Credit Karma - main use case: tax filing (yearly frequency) → new use case: credit monitoring (monthly frequency)

276;Pricing Page GIFs;"Increase the number of signups from the pricing page by adding GIFs to the pricing plan tooltips. This will help users easily understand your product's features without having to leave the page.
Here's a great example of this tactic in action: https://blackmagic.so/membership/
Instructions on how to implement it.";;Acquisition;pricing;No;Moderate;Yes;
277;Don't Require Email Verification on Signup;"Don't make users verify their emails on signup unless there's a security reason for it.
It's a friction point in the signup experience that risks getting the user distracted after she leaves the flow and causes drop-off (not to mention the cases  where the confirmation emails are delayed or not delivered because of technical reasons).
If there is a valid reason to require users to verify their emails, move this step as far as possible in the flow. Ideally, right before users perform the sensitive action.";;Activation;signup;No;Low;No;
278;Personal Communication;"Increase the reply rate of your feedback requests by making your communication more personal.
People prefer to interact with other people, not bots or generic support emails. So including a personal touch in your message might be the extra push needed to make users reply to you.
The attached screenshot from Airtable is a great example. When asking for feedback on my experience with their support, they included 3 elements making the interaction more personal:
Person's image
Person's name Person's short bio";;Activation Retention;email;No;Low;No;
279;Right Choice Confirmation;"During onboarding, reassure users your product is a good fit for their needs based on the choices they've made in the previous steps of the flow.
For example (based on the screenshots from the Loona app), if users signed up for your product hoping it will help them sleep and feel better, confirm that's the outcome other users like them get from using the app (and show proof).
Being aware that they're in the right place, users' motivation levels will stay high, which will increase the chance they'll successfully complete the onboarding flow.
To back up your claims, you can use either stats from similar users of your product (recommended) or relevant industry data (e.g. sales teams using lead enrichment software close 25% more leads).";;Activation;onboarding signup;No;Moderate;Yes;
280;Avoid Paid Individual Plans;"Focusing on team plans rather than individual plans will lead to increased retention rate and more expansion revenue.
Individual user companies have similar unit economics to B2C: low retention and a high support burden. For this reason, they can be useful to generate leads, but their long-term revenue potential is much lower than team plans.
Aspects of team products resulting in much better unit economics:
Higher engagement with the product → no single user can easily make the decision to churn.
Collaboration provides constant opportunities for reactivation (via engagement of other users)
→ lower chance of dormant users.
More users using the product means opportunity for expansion revenue and negative churn.";;Revenue;pricing;No;Moderate;No;
281;Create a Shared Enemy;"Identify and align your company against a shared enemy (behavior, belief, or shared philosophy) to create a sense of belonging in people who stand for the same values.
Examples: Signal vs companies neglecting usersʼ privacy, Typeform vs forms, Airtable vs spreadsheets.
The social identity theory says that the groups people belong to offer both identity (they tell us who we are) and self-esteem (they make us feel good about ourselves). And humans have a need to identify with groups in such a way as to maximize their uniqueness.
Fighting a shared enemy helps meet this need, creating brand loyalty as a result.
Note: this tactic is a much better fit for ‘painkillerʼ products (solving a problem) rather than ‘vitaminʼ products (that are nice-to-have).
Extra tip: give out swag related to these values, as a part of the movement.";;Acquisition Retention     Referral;copy;No;Moderate;No;
282;Length Implies Strength Heuristic;"Length implies strength heuristic says that the more you have to say, the more likely it is people will believe you.
So to make any kind of marketing content (ads, landing pages, emails) more persuasive and credible, load it with more words, benefits, testimonials, images, and even spacing.
This makes your audience say “Wow...look how much is here. It must be true.”
Examples of this heuristic in action: https://launchschool.com/love https://basecamp.com/customers Basically any info productʼs landing page";;Acquisition;"ads     content
copy     email social proof";No;Moderate;No;
283;Environment Habit Loops;"Accelerate the natural process of habit formation by creating an environment habit loop - placing visual cues near where the organic trigger occurs.
For many products, it's not possible to predict when users will experience the problem (or make them need the product at a given time) but it is possible to know in what situation it will happen.
Placing environmental triggers in their way makes it more likely that they'll take the action, get the reward, and thus complete the habit loop more often. Which makes it more likely they'll develop a habit around the product.
So to implement an environment habit loop, consider:
1.  In what situations users experience the need to
use your product
2.  How you can place something in their view to help them take the action that leads to a reward
Most common ways of creating environment loops include building browser extensions, establishing partnerships, and buying ads.
Examples:
Zoom - the trigger to use the product often occurs when users schedule a meeting in their calendar, so Zoom built a browser extension to make this action easier.
HubSpot - the trigger appears when users do
manual sales activities in their email, so HubSpot created a Gmail plugin that makes completing these tasks more convenient.
Loom - the trigger appears when users need to explain some process to someone else, so Loom created partnerships with Jira and Upwork, and also made their browser plugin display a widget on Google Sheets.
Uber and Lyft created a partnership with Google that allows them to display their ride offers exactly when users are searching for transportation (in Google Maps).
Buffer and Pinterest built browser extensions that display a button on any website's image, giving users an easy way to schedule (Buffer) or pin them (Pinterest).
S/o to Reforge for coming up with this concept.";;Activation Retention;;No;High;Yes;
;;;;;;;;;
284;Trial For All Freemium Users;"Increase the free to paid conversion rate by making the premium plan trial obligatory to all users signing up for the free plan.
By having more users experience the full range of features your product has to offer, a higher % of them will see the value and need for the features not available in the free plan.
At the end of the trial, remind them of the features they won't have access to if they don't upgrade (inducing loss aversion bias).
Also, let them know that if they don't take any action, they'll still be able to use the free plan of your product.
Note: this tactic makes sense only for products using feature-based pricing. Those with usage-based pricing (e.g. Dropbox charging users primarily based on storage) most likely won't benefit from applying  it.";;Activation Revenue;onboarding signup;No;Low;Yes;
285;Success States;"Let users know they've completed an action successfully using success states (also called confirmation states).
Success states are UI elements of interactions that let users know that they're on the right track or already achieved a goal.
Examples: message sent successfully, task completed, workflow activated.
The peak-end rule suggests that humans judge experiences based on how they felt at the peak moments, as well as how they felt at the end.
So making the success states satisfying will increase the probability of users repeating the action, strengthening the habit loop.
A success state must clearly communicate the confirmation message that reflects the scale of the action.
So, sending an email in Gmail (action that users do multiple times every day) will trigger a small notification in the corner of the page but publishing a new landing page should be much more pronounced
e.g. a full-screen popup.
Success states can be used to simply signal the end of the flow (inbox zero in Superhuman) or be both the confirmation of goal completion and show users a natural next action you want them to take.";;Activation Retention;onboarding;No;Moderate;Yes;
;;;;;;;;;
286;Find Expiring Annual Contracts;"Use BuiltWith to find companies whose annual contracts with your competitors expire soon. Here's how to do it.
Based on this intel, reach out to them offering your product as a superior solution. Pitch them the key advantages over your competitor.
The fact that these companies are already using a similar product means that they have a problem they need solving and if your product can do it better/easier/cheaper, they may be willing to switch providers.
Things to consider:
Adjust the time of reaching out based on both the notice period of the competing product and your average lead close rate. So e.g. if the notice period is 1 month and your avg close rate is 1 month, reach out at least 2 months before their contract ends so that they have enough time to cancel.
Offer free migration (if necessary) to lower the friction.
Offer your product for free until their contract with your competitor ends.
Don't mention you know when their contract expires - it will sound too shady.";;Acquisition;competitors email;Yes;Moderate;No;

287;'Even If' Copywriting Technique;"Remove readers' objections using an 'even if' copywriting technique to make them more willing to convert.
Generic formula: {Achieve desirable outcome} even if {objection}
Example: Build powerful automations even if you can't code
Your prospects always have certain doubts and uncertainties when researching the right solution for their needs. You should be aware of them and remove them from their path to conversion.
Using the 'even if' technique, you can proactively mention these objections to make users know you're aware of them and that your product can handle them.
Also, being upfront about it gives you an advantage over your competitors who don't mention it.";;Acquisition;ads     copy;No;Low;No;
288;Reward Reminders;"Build stronger retention by reminding users of the value they're getting from your product. Seeing tangible results will make them want to stick with it for longer and make them more likely to upgrade.
Making users aware of the value they got is the crucial third step of the habit loop (reward), especially important for products where users don't see the reward immediately after using them (e.g. tools working in the background).
Examples:
Loom shows how much time users saved by replacing meetings with Looms
Automation tools (e.g. Zapier) should show the estimated time users saved thanks to their processes being automated
Tools that save money should display the amount of money users saved thanks to them
For the reward to be most effective, the results you're showing must be in line with users' end goal of using your product (e.g. if users use Zapier to save time, it wouldn't make sense for Zapier to display how many tasks it automated for them because it's not what users came for).";;Retention Revenue;copy;No;Moderate;Yes;
289;Precommitment;"Help users build stronger habits around your product and improve retention by using precommitment.
Asking users to commit to a goal will help them follow through on their word and make them use your product consistently.
Examples:
Duolingo asking users to select a learning streak goal (see screenshot).
Coursera asking users to set weekly learning
goals.
Budgeting apps asking users to set a saving goal over a period of time.
Users' motivation is usually at its peak when signing up. Use it to make them pick an ambitious goal which will make them more likely to stay on track thanks to the commitment bias - our tendency to stay committed to our past behaviors even if they don't have desirable outcomes.
Two important things to keep in mind. First, make the goal about the input (what users can control), and not the output (the result). Second, the goal you're asking users to set should be their own choice - check out this experiment by  Duolingo.
How to make it even more effective:
Encourage users to share their commitments on social platforms or by creating accountability groups. Committing to a goal publicly puts a little pressure on them that helps them stick to their goals.
Whenever relevant, make users sign their name in the app (see screenshot). Signing makes them more likely to commit to their goal through the self-signaling effect (humans can influence their own self-beliefs through their actions).";;Activation Retention;gamification onboarding signup;No;Moderate;Yes;

290;Keyword Shortcuts;"Implement keyword shortcuts to help users be more efficient with your product thus increasing their retention.
Using the keyboard is the fastest way to navigate most modern software products for users familiar with them. And the time savings from doing so without shifting hand position compounds over time.
Very often (when shortcuts are available), super users are keyboard-only.
The benefit is that making users more efficient makes your product more valuable to them, and as a result, theyʼre more likely to retain. It also increases the cost of switching to another tool as they will not want to lose their levels of productivity.
There are 3 parts to a command palette:
1.  A shortcut to open the palette (very often ctrl/cmd + k)
2.  Fuzzy matching logic to easily find commands
3.  A way to see the keyword shortcuts so that users can use them directly next time
An out-of-the-box tool that lets you implement keyboard shortcuts and more: CommandBar.";;Retention;;No;Moderate;Yes;
291;Competitor vs Competitor Comparison;"Capture high-intent traffic by creating content comparing your competitors and including your own product in the mix.
Users searching for tool comparison content are at the decision-making stage of choosing a tool, so this type of posts tend to be high-converting if you can grab users' attention.
It's also a great tactic if there is not much search volume for phrases comparing you to your competitors yet (that's when you can use tactic #105, Competitor Comparison Pages).
Podia executed this tactic exceptionally well (example 1, example 2):
They mention their product right from the start. They begin with a convenient comparison table where their product is included and looks like the best option.
The comparison that follows is very in-depth. After describing each of their competitors' features, pros, and cons, they do the same thing about their own product.
There's a side-by-side comparison of Podia with each of the two competing tools individually.
There's a Podia free signup CTA after each section.
Crisp (while didn't optimize their content well for conversion) created 463 such pages, for a combination of each of their competitors: https://crisp.chat/en/comparisons/.";;Acquisition;content competitors;No;Moderate;No;

292;Data Import in Onboarding;"Help users get activated quicker by letting them easily import their data from other tools during the onboarding process.
Users moving from other tools are usually high-value as they have a proven need for the product, plus they already know what to do with it.
Providing an easy migration process during onboarding will decrease the setup time (and time to value), which in turn will make users more likely to retain for longer.
For users with high expected LTV, it makes sense to offer it even if your team will have to do it manually (see Tactic #171: Concierge Migration).";;Activation Retention;automation competitors onboarding;No;High;Yes;
293;Programmatic SEO;"Programmatically create landing pages at scale to rank for a large number of long-tail keywords.
Programmatic SEO can be a much more efficient way of generating high-intent organic traffic than manually writing each page's content.
Examples:
Zapier programmatically created tens of thousands of pages for all their integrations (Connect product 1 & product 2) (example page).
G2 used their own data + user-generated content to create tens of thousands of comparison pages (example) and 'alternative to' pages (example),
Rocketreach ranks for 1M+ pages with their
{person name}  email, { company}  details, and
{ company } email format pages.
How to do it (summary):
1.  Come up with head terms - the short-tail keywords related to your product that users may search for, e.g. Best Webflow apps
2.  Find modifiers - the keywords that will let you create specific high-intent phrases your potential users may search for, e.g. Best Webflow {modifier} apps -> Best Webflow contact form apps, Best Webflow popup apps, Best Webflow automation apps, etc.
3.  Gather data - you can use your own product data (like Zapier and Rocketreach), user- generated content (like G2), freely accessible datasets and APIs (like this, this, or this), scrape data from other sources, or use VAs (for smaller datasets). Or, a combination of the above.
4.  Generate page template(s) and programmatically fill it with content.

294;Conditional Freemium;"Activate more free plan users using a time-limited onboarding checklist. Allow them to keep using the free version of the product only if they complete the checkpoints in time. If not, they can start a free trial of a higher subscription plan.
The assumption here is that the drop in free plan users will be offset by:
a) higher activation rate of those who complete the
checklist (and who have a higher chance of upgrading to a paid plan in the long run)
b) higher % of users who go through the trial of a higher subscription plan";;Activation;gamification onboarding;No;High;Yes;
295;Avoid Hard Stops;"Paywall the resources users create above their plan limits and use them as an incentive to upgrade their subscription.
Imagine a scenario where you're using Loom's free plan with a 5-minute recording limit but you're cut off at the 5-minute mark without being able to capture everything you wanted to say.
You'd probably be pissed as you'd have to either:
a) Start from scratch and try to squeeze the content into the 5-minute limit.
b) Upgrade your plan and have to record the video from scratch anyway.
Now, imagine if instead of cutting you off, Loom would let you finish recording, gated your fully recorded video with a paywall, and let you upgrade to unlock it.
You'd now be grateful to Loom for letting you go over your plan limits which would make you more likely to upgrade your subscription plan.
The same idea applies to any other type of product where you can allow users to exceed their plan limits without incurring significant costs.";;Revenue;;No;Moderate;Yes;
296;Custom App Icons;"Fight notification badge fatigue by customizing your home screen app icon based on the type of notification.
Instead of overloading users with more and more notification badges, slightly modify your app icon to stand out from the crowd and increase the number of users that return to the app.";;Retention;mobile;No;Moderate;Yes;
297;Build vs Buy Calculator;"Help users decide to buy your software by showing them the true cost of building and maintaining a custom solution vs subscribing to your tool.
When evaluating software—especially if they're technical—users might think, “Yeah I could just build this myself.” But is it really worth it once you factor in time, effort, and opportunity cost?
A buy vs. build calculator can remove any hesitations by making the costs crystal clear, helping them realize that a custom internal tool isnʼt worth the hassle.
