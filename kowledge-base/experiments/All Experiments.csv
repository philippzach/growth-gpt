1;Monopolize Search Ads;If your products are available on other sites, consider using Google Search Ads to send visitors to them beyond your own site. This way your brand captures more real estate in the search results, which means higher CTR (3 top ads in the screenshots are Casper's too).;;Traffic;;ads;Moderate;No;
2;Target Facebook Groups Members;While it's not possible to target Facebook group members with ads directly through ads manager, there are two workarounds: #1Join the group you want to targetUsing your business page, create a video that's relevantand valuable to the group audience Share the video in the group (go to video -> share -> share in a group) (from your personal account) Create a custom audience of people that interacted with it. Target the custom audience with ads #2 Contact the group admin and ask if they're willing to sell access to any of the custom audiences they've builtaccess to any of the custom audiences they've builtbased on their group members. Here's how it can be https://www.facebook.com/business/help/49929066382;;Traffic;;ads     social;Moderate;No;
3;Quiz to Help Choose a Product;If you're e.g. selling one type of product in several configurations - help visitors choose the right option using a quiz. Not only they will easier find what they are looking for but also they'll be more convinced that they are making the right choice for their needs.;;Conversion;Homepage;;Moderate;Yes;
4;Interactive Sizing Guides;"Good sizing guides help greatly reduce the number of returns and increase conversion rates, yet are often neglected. The more accurate they are, the better for your business metrics.
You can take a regular sizing chart a step further, and offer interactive guides which are a better experience for shoppers.
A couple of considerations to make them as accurate as possible:
- use brand-specific guides
- display sizing info only for the specific item being viewed to avoid any confusion
- display the sizing guide link in a clearly visible location
- show info on how other customers rate the sizing of a given item e.g. 'fits larger than expected'
Example tools: www.fitanalytics.com/fit-finder, www.boldmetrics.com, www.tangiblee.com";;Conversion;Product details page;tool;Moderate;Yes;
5;Birthday Ads;"Target your ads to people with birthday/friends of people with birthday soon. Surprise them with a celebratory copy, image and a special offer just for them. This is an evergreen campaign - the audience is dynamic, meaning
- you won't have any ad frequency issues. This tactic is proven to work especially well for brick and mortar businesses.";;Traffic;;ads     social;Low;No;
6;Tunnel Checkout;Remove header and footer from checkout to create a distraction-free 'tunnel'. Reducing the number of options a user has will increase the chance they will perform the action you want them to take and proceed further in the checkout process.;;Conversion;Checkout;;Low;Yes;
7;Bid on Competitors' YouTube Videos;"Grab the attention of users watching YouTube videos about your competitors using in-stream ads.
Google lets you hyper-target your ads to specific videos, which makes it a perfect opportunity to capture some of your competitors' potential or existing users.
With in-stream ads, you can show your ad before, during, or after your competitor's video.
There are two types of in-stream ads you can choose from:
- Skippable ads - after 5 seconds, the viewer can skip the ad, so it's crucial that you make the beginning engaging enough that users will continue to watch it past the 5 seconds point. The cool thing about this ad type is that you only pay when a viewer watches at least 30 seconds of your video (or the full duration of the video if it's shorter than 30 seconds) or interacts with your  video, whichever comes first.
- Non-skippable ads - users don't have an option to skip the ad, but you pay for all impressions it gets.
To capture even more real estate with your ads, you can reach users at an earlier step - when they're searching for a video. Using video discovery ads, your banners will show up on YouTube search results pages. Clicking the ad will drive users to your video.";;Traffic;;ads     videos;Low;No;

8;Auto-Display Cart Content on Return Visit;Increase the conversion rate of users who add products to cart but don't complete their purchase in a given visit to your store by displaying cart content on their next visit. This way they won't forget about it plus, you can add a custom message with a discount if they checkout in the next e.g. 10 minutes.;;Conversion;Homepage  Category page Product details page;;Moderate;Yes;
9;Don't Force Account Creation;"Forcing users to create accounts during checkout is a sure way to cause a significant drop-off. Instead, offer a guest checkout option and create an account for them using the data that you collect during checkout.
35% of users will abandon the checkout if a retailer does not offer guest checkout.";;Conversion;Checkout;;Moderate;Yes;
10;Bid on Competitors' Phrases;Bidding on your competitors' brand keywords suggesting users are experiencing issues with their product (e.g. [competitor's name] + help/support/contact etc.) is a great way to get in front of an audience that may be happy to consider other products. Drive the traffic to a landing page comparing your competitor's product against yours and explaining why it's worth making a switch.;;Traffic;;ads;Low;No;
11;Place Your Product in Stock Photos;"Use your lifestyle product photos (or arrange a photoshoot) and put them on stock photo websites like Unsplash or Pexels. People will download them and use them in their content, giving your products free exposure.
While the stock websites recommend people give credit and link back to the authors' websites, most don't do it. Find all websites using your photos, reach out to them, and ask for a backlink to your site.

12;Donʼt Bundle Products with Marginally Different Prices;"Known as presenter's paradox, the value of bundled items get averaged, not added. So when you're selling a
$1,999 laptop and bundle it with a $19 mouse, the mouse
reduces the perceived value to $1,009 ($1999 + $19 divided by 2).
How to do bundling right:
- when offering items with different values, establish values of the individual items first, especially the more expensive one
- emphasize how the cheaper product makes the more expensive one better
- focus on other attributes than price alone e.g. durability
or comfort

13;Rule of 100;Give percentage discounts on prices below $100 and absolute discounts above that value. If you're using site- wide discounting use the $100 threshold for average order value at your store.

14;Influencers Niche Rollout;Sponsor multiple influencers from the same niche at the same time. This will create an impression that your company is bigger than it really is because 'everyone' in your industry is talking about your product.;;Traffic;;ads;Moderate;No;
15;Exchange Facebook Pixel Data;"To reach new Facebook audiences with your ads, you can exchange your pixel data with other advertisers. If there is a company that you know has a similar audience to you but is not a direct competitor, this could be a worthwhile tactic for both of you.
There are a couple of ways to do that:
- share the whole pixel data (details: https://www.facebook.com/business/help/27905999606 9252?id=2042840805783715)
- share an audience (details: https://www.facebook.com/business/help/49929066382 3687?id=2469097953376494)

16;Delivery Date, Not Shipping Speed;"Following the golden UX rule ""Don't make users think"", show visitors estimated delivery dates instead of the commonly used shipping speeds.
Use: “Arrives December 20-22”, instead of“2-4 day delivery”.
Why? Users have a difficult time assessing when they will receive their order when shipping speed is used. They don't know factors such as your processing times and if the delivery speed includes holidays and weekends. They have to do this math themselves, which doesn't help them make a decision and check out.
For Shopify stores, you can even use an app to help you: https://apps.shopify.com/omega-estimated-shipping- date";;Conversion;Product details page Cart     Checkout;shipping;Low;Yes;
17;Create a Ritual Around Your Product;"Create a ritual around using a product to increase user satisfaction and willingness to pay.
The ritual (e.g. a specific series of movements or behaviors) creates the feeling that the product is part of something we created. And humans value more what we create ourselves, also known as the 'IKEA effect'.
Ritual examples:
- Oreo: separating and licking the biscuits.
- Jeep: Jeep drivers are required to wave to other Jeep drivers, the so-called 'Jeep Wave'.
The ritual is most powerful when performed before the product is consumed and performed by the person consuming it e.g. the person opening and pouring a bottle of wine will likely enjoy it more than others she's drinking it with.
Another benefit is that rituals help create habits, which help retain users.

Best performing e-commerce sites have 6-8 fields, while the average checkout flow has even 14-15 form fields - way too many.
How you can make your forms shorter:
1. Use a full name field, lose the title
2. Make the shipping address the default billing address

25;Resend Emails to Non-openers with New Subject Lines;48hrs or so after the first send, resend your email to non-openers with a changed subject line. There's no need to write a whole new email content if your email was not even opened.;;Traffic;;emails;Low;No;
26;Shipping Cost on Product Details Page;"A large part of shoppers look for shipping costs as early as on the product details page. Not displaying this info will make them wander to other parts of your store in search of this cost. This not only is not a perfect user experience but also makes the customer journey longer.
Instead, show the minimum shipping cost on the product details page by default. If the shipping cost is significant and depends on multiple conditions, use an expandable cost calculator.";;Conversion;Product details page;shipping;Low;Yes;

30;Donʼt Make Users Confirm Account Information;"Adding email and password confirmation fields to your signup forms means extra fields to fill in therefore it takes extra time to complete sign up. Which of course lowers conversion rate.
Instead, implement a password field unmasking option so that users see what they're typing.";;Conversion;Checkout;forms;Low;No;
31;Search Autocomplete;"Adding or improving (autocomplete) on a search box will increase the average search length by 1.6 words (from 1.7 to 3.3) (Nachoanalytics data). Having good auto- complete changes what gets searched, making the searches more specific and relevant. And by making the searches more specific, the quality of the search result becomes better, making people more likely to click on them. So as search length increases so does the conversion rate.

Not enabling this option creates a really bad experience for shoppers who need to go back and forth when choosing products. And more time needed to select a product means higher drop-off.";;Conversion;Category page;;Low;Yes;

Don't make them create an account to save a product  but try to get their email anyway by explaining how they'll benefit e.g. they'll get notified when the price drops.
If they do create an account, use this opportunity to remind them about the products on their wishlist when

39;Move Subdomains to Subdirectories;"Get more SEO juice from Google by moving your blog from subdirectory to subdomain i.e. blog.website.com -> website.com/blog
Moz found that by structuring your site with subdomains, you may confuse search engines. Also, you will separate a large portion of keywords under the subdomain and dilute backlink strength.
When does using subdomains make sense? When each subdomain functions as a separate entity within the overall corporation. Disney, for example, has cars.disney.com, videos.disney.com, disneyparks.disney.com, princess.disney.com, and each one serves a very different purpose. Backlinks to each of them won't dilute the topical focus of the site.";;Traffic;;seo;Moderate;Yes;

41;Show All Product Gallery Images;"As a crucial element in the decision-making process, product images must be clearly displayed to users. Truncating the additional product thumbnails (e.g. by using a manual carousel) causes a large part of users to overlook the truncated product images.

If youʼre not offering free shipping, try to figure out a way you can offer it. Even though sometimes it might be almost impossible to make it profitable, there are a couple of strategies worth testing:
1. First, check the difference in conversion with and without free shipping

Grid view is better suited for product categories where visuals are more important - clothes or watches for example.

Also, when we buy a product that exhausts our remaining budget, the negative emotions associated with spending the money are transferred onto the product, influencing its ratings. This phenomenon is called the 'bottom dollar effect'.
Youʼre more likely to buy a product (and be satisfied with it) when you have more money left in your budget. So plan your promotions accordingly.

83;Welcome Discount;"Getting a user to make their first purchase is more difficult than getting them to buy from you again. Lower the friction to the first purchase by offering a small welcome discount.
Maximize the perceived discount size by following the 'Rule of 100' - give percentage discounts if your average order value is under $100 and absolute discounts above that price point. People will feel they're getting an even better deal.
Additionally, make it as easy as possible to apply the promo code - automatically applied to their cart on click if possible.";;Conversion;Homepage  Category page Product details page;discounts;Low;No;
84;Currency Localization;"Having to convert prices during shopping distracts the shoppers from purchase and leads to suboptimal conversion rates.
Let international users check out in their native currencies. Provide them with the localized experience they expect and improve your conversion rates.
Your best bet is to use a third-party software that will do it automatically based on visitor's IP address, as well as round prices so that they look natural.

86;Display Prices in Small Font Size;"Human brain perceives prices to be smaller when they're displayed in smaller font size.
On your product detail pages, surround prices with other, larger elements. They will emphasize the small size of  the price, which in turn will make the product seem cheaper.

87;Altruistic Referrals;"Humans are more altruistic than we think.
Test wording your referral call to action as 'give $10 to a friend' rather than 'get $10 by inviting a friend', as well as adding or removing the incentive for the inviting user.
Word of mouth referrals is something people do altruistically because we think the referred person will like it. Adding a selfish incentive (get $10 yourself) creates a contrast between the two motivations which neutralize each other.";;Traffic;;referrals;Moderate;No;

90;Offer a Guarantee;"If you have a really solid product with very low return and complaint rates you should consider offering a guarantee.
Guarantees are effective when:
- users want what the company is promising
- users are nervous about the risk associated with buying the product or skeptical about your claims
- your service does live up to the claims you make
The best guarantees are worded positively. E.g. instead of saying “If you dislike our service…” say, “We guarantee that youʼll love our service.”";;Conversion;Homepage  Category page Product details page Cart     Checkout;;Low;No;

92;Prominent Search Bar;"If you sell products that people know to search for, make the search bar big and prominent. If executed well, the conversion rate of users using the search bar will be higher than that of those who don't. Make sure the autocomplete feature works fine - longer, more specific searches return more relevant results, which in turn increases the chance of users clicking on them.
This is especially relevant for stores with a large number of SKUs.";;Conversion;Homepage  Category page Product details page;search;Low;Yes;
93;Customize Landing Page Based on Referral Source;"If you're getting a significant amount of traffic to one of your pages from a given referrer, it makes a lot of sense to treat it like a landing page for paid campaigns - customize it to the traffic source for highest relevance.
E.g. traffic coming from Noah Kagan's post -> use Noah Kagan's image and custom copy. Or, a more advanced example: add a section to the referral landing page that pulls stats from the referrerʼs usage of the product: “John, uses product_name X times per week to do Y. Heʼs saved Z hours/dollars using it.” (get an engineer to have the landing page automatically pull this non- sensitive data from the inviterʼs account.)";;Conversion;Homepage  Category page Product details page;personalizati…;Moderate;No;

99;Before & After;"In a study of 70 campaigns with transparent sales results, Gallup didn't find a single before & after campaign that didnʼt increase sales. They work so well because they use 2 main drivers to persuade people:
1. Pain (people's current state)
2. Desired outcome (where they want to be)
Note that Facebook doesn't allow to use before & after images to promote diet, weight loss, or other health- related products. You are free to use them for all other topics though. E.g. 'Before using tool X, company Y spent 12 hours a week on finding relevant contact info. Now, the whole process is streamlined thanks to tool X and takes just an hour a week. If that employee's time is worth $50/hour that's $550 savings a week and $2200 a month!'";;Traffic;;images;Moderate;Yes;

107;Accelerated Retargeting;"Increase the performance of your retargeting ad campaigns by adjusting the frequency over time.
The more time passes after someone visited your site, the less likely they are to click on your retargeting ad. How can you take advantage of this fact and optimize your retargeting campaign?
Split your campaign into 2-3 ad groups based on the time passed since users visited your site e.g.:
- ad group 1: high frequency, 2-3x/day for the first week after visit
- ad group 2: lower frequency: 1x/day for the next 1 week
- ad group 3: occasional: 1x/every 2-3 weeks
Remember to always take your average time to close a deal into consideration when setting retargeting frequency.";;Traffic;;ads;Moderate;No;
108;Easy to Compute Discounts;"Known as 'ease of computation effect', consumers' judgment of the magnitude of difference between numbers is influenced by how easy it is to compute.
This heuristic can make people incorrectly judge the difference to be larger for pairs with easier computations (e.g., $5.00 - $4.00) than for pairs with difficult computations (e.g., $4.97 - $3.96).
Conclusion: make your discounts easy to compute to maximize their perceived magnitude.

111;Pricing - Decoy Effect;"Made famous by The Economist magazine's pricing page (they still use it, so it's been probably working well for them), decoy effect is a cognitive bias where people change their preferences regarding two options when a third, asymmetrically dominated, is introduced.
I.e. when there are only two options - people make a choice based on their personal preferences. But when offered a third option (priced a little lower than the most expensive one and/or with much worse features), they are more likely to choose the more expensive of the two original options.";;Conversion;Product details page;pricing;Low;No;
112;Respond to Negative Customer Reviews;"Majority of ecommerce companies don't reply to reviews left by their customer. This not only makes shoppers doubtful about the actual quality of the product but also about the quality of support they are to expect from the brand.
So replying to an unhappy customer won't change their satisfaction with the product they bought but will surely make an impression on other shoppers reading the reply that the company actually cares about its customers.
And this is something heavily underestimated by many businesses.
Also, make sure reviews left by your customer support team are easily distinguishable from those left by other shoppers.";;Conversion;Product details page;reviews;Low;No;

122;Upfront Progress;People feel a higher need to complete a task as it gets closer to completion. That's why some coffee shops give away pre-stamped cards with two stamps instead of one.

127;Add More Use Cases;"Products that are bought infrequently (e.g. once a year) are in danger of being forgotten about when the next buying opportunity happens. Companies selling them end up re-acquiring users, which is expensive.
The solution to this problem is adding more use cases around your product to stay top of mind of users.
For example, a user may need Patagonia's adventure gear once or twice a year, so it's easy for her to forget about them next time she shops for this kind of stuff and choose a competitor.
What Patagonia does to combat this is they create lots of adventure content on their social channels, that they invite users to after they make a purchase. This way, Patagonia stays top of mind as users consume this type of content frequently.
Of course, producing such content is not cheap. But for the long-term growth of products with infrequent use cases, adding another use case is often necessary.";;Traffic;;;High;No;

That's why they're more likely to take another action now. Or, refer a friend. Plus, you already have their contact info, so they don't have to input it again to convert once more. This tactic leverages what's called a 'yes ladder', or 'foot in the door' technique. Once someone says 'yes' once, they're more likely to say 'yes' once more.;;Conversion;Checkout;upsell;Low;No;
153;Trust Seals at Checkout;Trust seals make customers feel more comfortable handing over their sensitive information to you and increase your conversions.

154;Formatted Credit Card Form Field;"Typing 16 digits in a row often results in errors. Help users prevent that when inputting their credit card number by formatting this form field into four 4-digit groups separated by spaces (as on physical cards) or dashes.

166;'Happy Birthday' Reactivation Email;Use this tactic as a final attempt to bring inactive users back. It relies on the same logic as Birthday Paradox - in a room of 23 people, there's a 50% chance that 2 of them have a birthday on the same day. If you apply this to your email list, there's a big chance that a part of them just had, or will soon have a birthday. To target an even larger group of people, say 'Happy (belated) Birthday' in the subject line. Then just say that you're sorry you missed their birthday but have a special promo for them. It's hard to imagine someone reacting negatively to birthday wishes and a promo offer.;;Traffic;;emails;Low;No;

168;Avoid Banner-Only Free Shipping Info;"Very often, the 'free shipping' info is available only in the site-wide banner at the top of the page. But because of banner blindness (people's tendency to ignore page elements that they perceive to be ads), this message is ignored by some part of users.
Instead, display the 'free shipping' info near the main call to action button on the product details pages, where it's much easier for the user to notice.";;Conversion;Product details page;shipping;Low;Yes;

170;Where Should We Send Your Code;"When offering promo codes for visitors' email address, don't say generic stuff like 'sign up to our newsletter to get a promo code'. People usuall don't care about the newsletter part - they just want the promo code. Instead, make the offer only about the code and get their email by asking 'where should we send your promo code?'. This justifies your ask and makes users more likely to leave their email.
To make this tactic even more effective, arouse their curiosity and don't say what the discount is. They'll learn only after submitting their email.";;Conversion;Homepage  Category page Product details page;discounts;Low;No;

Cross-sells work best when the suggested products are at least 50% cheaper than the originally added product.";;Conversion;Cart;upsell;Moderate;Yes;
173;Allow Purchasing Temporarily ‘Out of Stockʼ Items;"When users find a product on your site that they want to buy but it's out of stock, they'll either look for alternatives on your site or will just look for it elsewhere.
If a product is regularly replenished, allow users to purchase it by increasing delivery time. Just make sure to communicate it clearly what the expected wait time is.";;Conversion;Product details page;;Low;Yes;
174;Show Both Related & Complementary Products;"When users visit product pages, it can be for different reasons and from different sources.
Sometimes, they haven't decided on the specific product they need - that's why you should show them alternative products. For those that have already made their mind, suggestions of complementary items help them 'finish the look' and increase your average order value.
Showing both these suggestion types caters to shoppers at both decision stages, which is a win for your business.";;Conversion;Product details page;;Low;Yes;

- Gather customer feedback about new products you're about to launch
- Reduce the % of returns
- Increase the % of repeat customers by sending samples of products they haven't bought yet
Why do free samples work?
Reciprocity principle - humans tend to return the favor. So when they get something from you for free, it increases the chance of them doing something nice in return, like making a purchase.
Also, being able to sample the product beforehand lowers the perceived risk of making a purchase they'll regret.";;Conversion;Product details page;;Moderate;No;
181;Reduce Cart Abandonment Using Chatbots;"Don't wait until visitors leave your site to trigger an email cart abandonment sequence. Use a chatbot instead and save more abandoned carts than with email.
Trigger a chatbot when a visitor is about to leave your website (when their cursor leaves the tab) and engage them with the same offer that you're using in your email sequence.
Offer them a % off or simply ask for the reason they're leaving and let your customer support team take the conversation over.";;Conversion;Cart     Checkout;;Moderate;No;
182;Transparent Pricing;"Build trust in your brand by displaying the cost breakdown of your products
Your customers will appreciate the honesty and transparency which will help you build broader relationships with them and ultimately increase your LTV.
Research shows that price transparency is effective at influencing consumer behavior when selling low-end products. Not only can it increase their willingness to pay but also accelerate their purchase.

The goal: by understanding the product better, they will be able to get more value and satisfaction out of it. This, in turn, will create higher-value customers over their lifecycle.
Example content to share:
Reiterate the fact that they've made the right choice by showing the reviews of happy customers. Make them feel a part of the movement/values your brand stands for.

185;Comparison Charts;"Display a comparison chart showing the superiority of your product either over a competitors' product or the current solution your audience is used to using.
Comparisons vs current solution help visitors understand how your product can benefit them in ways they weren't aware of as they were used to a more traditional solution.
Comparisons vs competitors will help you convert users at the bottom of the funnel - those who know they need a product like yours but are still undecided on the brand. A comparison table makes this decision so much easier than clicking between multiple tabs. Can be especially impactful for products with comparable specifications (e.g. electronics).";;Conversion;"Homepage

They're best used either as a product overview in the top section of PDP, at the bottom of the page to summarize what users just read, as well as within the product image carousel.
Just make sure not to overload the infographics with text. Use dedicated sections on the page to go into each feature's details.";;Conversion;"Homepage

189;QR Codes on Product Labels;"Place QR codes on your products to increase engagement with your brand which will result in higher retention and increased LTV.
You can use QR codes in multiple ways:
Sharing content enhancing the experience with your product e.g. recipes, tutorials, customer-only events, playlists. It engrains customers into your brand and encourages more purchases in the future. You can also change the content of the page that the QR code links to every day or week and encourage customers to keep coming back to see whatʼs new. Sparking their curiosity can help you establish a habit.
Cross-selling complementary products that improve the overall experience.
Re-ordering the product when customers run out of
it. Use an app like Repeat to let your customers scan the QR code and reorder the products in under 15 seconds without the need to create any accounts. This will also help you gather valuable data on replenishment intervals which will, in turn, let you better optimize your other lifecycle campaigns (email, SMS).";;Conversion;;;Moderate;No;
190;Recover Failed Subscription Payments;"Reduce involuntary churn by sending automated messages to customers whose subscription payments didn't go through.
The vast majority of credit cards expire every 36 months, which means about 2.8% of your customers' cards will expire every month. This can lead to over 30% of revenue loss from annual subscriptions every year. The longer your plans are, the higher the chance of CC expirations preventing successful billing.
Another reason for failed payments can be mechanical failures of your tools. Make sure to review the connection points between your merchant provider, bank, and payment processor to alleviate any issues. These types of issues should be easy to avoid.
How to make the renewal messages (SMS/emails) as efficient as possible:
Remind your customers of the value they've been
getting from your product to make sure their motivation is high before updating their CC details Reduce friction as much as possible - include a custom link driving users straight to the payment update page with pre-populated fields
Tools:

191;Founder Story;"Use a founder story to build a more personal connection with your audience.
People prefer to buy from other individuals and companies they like (Cialdini's liking principle), and whose stories they identify with because of similarities or shared values.
A good founder story should talk about:
The issues or challenges that made the founder start the company.
How the company and products answer these
issues.
What are the founder's and company's values. How the founder's life has improved after starting to use his own products.
Some example pages displaying a founder story: https://try.dyper.com/promo/halfbundle/ https://offers.kettleandfire.com/immunity -21/ https://shop.hopwtr.com/lp1/ https://get.magicspoon.com/miss-cereal-2/cb.html";;Conversion;"Homepage

193;Post-Purchase Contest;"Encourage customers to share UGC content on socials by running a monthly contest.
Use the moment when your customers' motivation is at its peak (after they receive the product) and include an invitation to take part in the contest where they can win prizes by sharing their photos with your products.
This is a simple and low-cost way of incentivizing users to share on socials and a great way of collecting more UGC content that you'll be able to later use on your website and in ads.

194;Shipping Insurance Upsell;"Increase your AOV by adding a shipping insurance option to the checkout.
In most cases, stores don't dispute with customers when a shipment has been lost or delivered damaged. They simply send a new product free of charge.
Instead of providing such 'insurance' for free, make it an upsell in the checkout and easily increase your AOV by a couple dollars.
The more fragile the product, the more effective this tactic will be.

195;Coaching Service;"Improve the retention of your subscriptions by offering training/coaching services that will help your customers get more value from your product, faster.
The sooner your customers start to see or feel the effects of your product, the more likely they are to keep using it and ultimately develop a habit around it.
The support of a specialist such as a nutritionist or personal trainer will make them more advanced in using the product, keep them accountable, and accelerate the process of habit formation.
Aside from improving retention, coaching services are an extra value proposition that can also improve the conversion rate to purchase.

196;Delivery Cost Calculator on PDP;"Display a delivery cost calculator on the product details page to anticipate the doubt that a large part of   shoppers will have. Especially when selling bulky items or shipping worldwide.
Waiting to display this information until the last checkout step is not a good user experience, so the sooner users see it, the better.";;Conversion;Product details page;shipping;Moderate;Yes;
197;Offboarding Flow;"Add offboarding to your subscription cancellation process to save some of the churning customers and collect qualitative feedback from the rest.
This is one of the few cases where adding (a little) friction is actually a good thing.
Users subscribed to your product for a reason - remind them of the value theyʼll lose if they stop using your products on a regular basis (loss aversion bias).
Then, ask what's the reason they're leaving. Based on their answer, you can offer them a salvage offer and try to retain them.
Some example offers to try and make them stay: Downgrade to a less frequent subscription Let them pause their subscription
Give a one-time discount
Even if you fail to make them stay, such offboarding flow will let you collect some valuable feedback that will help you make the experience better for other users.
Based on ProfitWell's study of 1k+ subscription ecommerce companies, stores offering a smooth offboarding experience and salvage offers can save even 15-30% of cancellations.

198;Post-Purchase Survey;"Use a post-purchase survey to discover valuable insights about your customers and the user journey of your store that will help you improve the experience for future visitors.
To implement it, add an extra step to your checkout flow by adding a survey right after users finalize their order. That's when their memory of the whole shopping process is the freshest and will result in the highest- quality insights for you.
For best results, use a single open-ended question. Some good examples:
What almost stopped you from completing your
purchase? / What is one thing you'd improve about our website experience? This question will help you discover problems such as fears and doubts that weren't addressed, checkout issues, weak value prop, confusion about how the product works, etc.
What made you buy from us? Ask this question to
learn the most important aspect of your product or brand that may be worth highlighting even more on your website and in your communication.";;Conversion;Checkout;;Low;No;

Pela, eco-friendly phone cases: ""You care about the planet. Pela makes it easy to show it.""

200;Limited Edition Products OTO;"Increase your AOV by offering limited edition products as a one-time offer after users complete their purchase.
Users' motivation is at its peak right after their order so offering an upsell at this point is best practice.
To make the offer even more compelling, present them
with an opportunity to buy products that are not available anywhere else on your website. For example: new flavor, smell, color, material.
Triggering scarcity will make this offer hard to turn down
- mention these 3 things for best results:
It's the only time they will be able to buy these products
The offer will disappear after x minutes
The stock is limited and they can't order more than x products";;Conversion;Checkout;upsell;High;No;
201;Product Samples;"Include product samples in the shipment to: Increase the chance of repeat purchases of the sampled products (cross-sell)
Get feedback on new products before they're launched
Incentivize word of mouth by letting your customers share the samples with their friends. Make sure to mention the samples are specifically for their friends.
Product sampling is effective not just because consumers can purchase the full product with confidence but also because of reciprocity - in exchange for getting something from you for free, they feel compelled to return the favor.
To make the most out of samples:
Include an insert explaining why they received a given sample, along with product information and benefits. Treat it as a landing page.
Provide a clear call to action and include a QR code to let them easily order a full product (or leave feedback).
Include a special one-time offer and use scarcity to incentivize action.";;Conversion;;shipping;High;No;
202;Recommend Subscription Frequency Based on Product Usage;"Improve retention by suggesting to users the right subscription frequency based on typical product usage.
Picking the frequency that fits users' needs has a large impact on if they will keep their subscription active:
If the frequency is too high, they'll hoard too much
of the product and eventually cancel their subscription (or pause in the best-case scenario). If the frequency is too low, they won't have enough of the product to use it regularly and build a habit around it.
A simple way of solving this challenge is displaying a helper message near the frequency selector that recommends the subscription frequency based on how the product is typically used.

203;Hero Image Captions;"Add captions to your PDP hero product images to make sure users focus on the features you meant to highlight.
While it may be obvious to you, it's not always so obvious to visitors what an image was supposed to emphasize.
Adding a little bit of extra context can make a big
difference.
Captions are particularly useful for close-up shots and images showing your products in real-life situations.";;Conversion;Product details page;images;Low;No;
204;Save Your Cart;"Reduce the cart abandonment rate by letting users save their cart contents for later.
Adding a product to cart doesn't always mean a user is planning to check out soon. Carts are also a form of 'external memory' used for storing products for later. This is especially true for products that aren't impulse buys and where users start their research process on mobile and finish on desktop.
So to let users easily finish their order at a later time, on a different device, or send it to someone else to pay for their order, a 'save your cart' feature should be implemented.
An extra benefit is that it also gives you an opportunity to follow up with such shoppers with an email drip.
An effective 'save your cart' feature in a cart must be: Easily noticeable
Clear how it works (users should have no doubt about what to do to finish their order at a later time) Low friction (no need to sign up or name the list)";;Conversion;Cart;;Moderate;Yes;
205;Order More to Get More Gifts;"Increase AOV by offering free gifts for ordering more products.
The more products users add to cart, the more gifts they get. And the more products ordered, the nicer the gifts. A double incentive that makes this offer even more compelling.
To maximize the impact of this tactic, make sure the gifts further enhance users' experience with the main product.";;Conversion;Product details page;upsell;High;Yes;
206;New Communication Channel Incentives;"Gain a new communication channel with your customers by offering an incentive for leaving their phone number at checkout.
New commuinication channel means higher LTV, so offering something like order updates or even a coupon for their next order will be worth it in the long run.";;Conversion;Checkout;;Moderate;Yes;
207;Discourage From Buying Your Product;"'Discourage' users from buying your product to make them want it even more.
Don't be afraid of telling people why they shouldnʼt buy what youʼre selling. It boosts your credibility, shows confidence, and if the users are your actual target audience, this type of copy will increase their desire to buy.
Examples:
Supplements: 'If you expect instant results,
{product name} is not for you. But those who use it regularly for at least 3-4 weeks report significant increases in x and y'. Then, support the claim with a couple of testimonials mentioning the results.
Coffee alternative: 'If caffeine crashes are your
thing, you won't like {product name}. But if you try it once, we promise you'll never go back to your old coffee habit.' You can follow it with a money-back guarantee.

208;Good-Better-Best Pricing;"Increase AOV by offering CPG products in tiered pricing tables.
This pricing strategy, called Good-Better-Best, is more commonly used in SaaS and its goal is to incentivize users to pick a more expensive option.
In ecommerce, it can be used to encourage users to pick more than one product by emphasizing the benefits of ordering more by:
Highlighting discounts
Adding labels (e.g. ""Most popular"", ""Best value"", ""Biggest savings"") to make more expensive options more compelling
And also, recommending the ""tier"" based on user type (in the screenshot, the household size labels reduce cognitive load and help users to self-select the tier that's best for them)";;Conversion;Product details page;discounts pricing upsell;Moderate;Yes;
209;Process Transparency;"Increase credibility and perceived product value by making your production process transparent.

210;Price Justification;"Increase perceived product value by being upfront about why it's priced at a premium compared to other, similar products.
When selling commodity products at a higher-than- average price, you have to be explicit about what makes them worth their price to avoid any doubts in shoppers' heads.
Adding a separate section talking about just this aspect is a smart way of emphasizing your product's distinguishing features. Plus, it makes you look confident in its quality by being so transparent about it.

214;Let Users Self-Qualify;"Instead of trying to convince users that your product is right for them, help them make that decision themselves.
People generally dislike being sold to. So if you create an impression that the choice is their own and they have control, they'll be more confident about their choice and satisfied with their purchase.
To create this feeling, show the criteria users will internally say ""yes"" to, like in the example from NoonBrew.
The self-qualification criteria can be:
Aspirational - based on how users want to improve their lives.
Persona-based - matching the characteristics of
your target audience (stage of life, personality, interests, lifestyle etc.)
Problem-based - mentioning your target audience's main pain points.
The goal is to make users answer ""yes"" to as many criteria as possible, giving them the impression your product is made for them.";;Conversion;"Homepage

215;Word Picture Copy;"Make bland copy engaging and hold users' attention by replacing vague copy with word picture copy.
Painting a vivid mental picture of how your product will benefit your prospects triggers emotions, making your copy and products memorable.
To pull it off, use metaphors and similes to stimulate the five senses:
Sight: gleaming, tarnished, shadowy, sparkling,
dancing
Touch: velvety, icy, sharp, blunt Taste: bitter, zesty, refreshing Scent: musty, fragrant, sweet Sound: roar, sizzle, murmur
Word of caution: don't overdo it. Too much word picture copy can overwhelm the reader and diminish the impact of each vivid description.

216;Display Bundles as Variants;"Displaying bundles more prominently on the PDP will increase the AOV.
Instead of showing bundles in the lower part of the page, move them into the variants section. They'll get more impressions which will result in more users selecting them which means higher AOV.";;Conversion;Product details page;;Low;No;
217;Build Your Own Bundle;"Increase your AOV by letting users create their own bundle by selecting several items from a pre-defined set of products.
The Build Your Own Bundle (BYOB) tactic gives users a sense of control over their shopping experience which increases engagement and satisfaction with their purchase.
Here's how to make the most of BYOB:
1.  Use tiered cart threshold incentives (tactic #187) - encourage shoppers to add more products by offering gifts and discounts based on the number of items selected. The gifts' value should increase  with the cart value.
2.  Don't overwhelm users with too many product options.
3.  Display real-time status about their discounts and
benefits to keep their motivation high.

;Facebook Call-To-Action;Testing different CTA text options on Facebook Ads. Different CTAs can resonate differently with audiences. Learn More can be less pushy than Sign Up, etc...;;;;;;;
;Twitter Hashtag Listbuilding & Targeting;"Hashtags can be great qualifiers for targeting, and this tactic will allow you to target events not listed under Twitters internal event targeting. To create a list based on a hashtag (i.e. for an event) you will need to: 1. Create a Twitter list (make sure you select ""private""; if relevant) 2. Create an IFTTT recipe, specifying the hashtag you want to track and the name of the list you just created. 3. For paid advertising, once your list is built, you can export it and then import it to Twitter as a tailored audience 4. Create campaign targeting the new custom audience";;;;;;;
;Gender-Focused Ad Copy;Products and offers are commonly advertised differently to different genders. Your copy should reflect this fact. Use gender targeting and create gender focused copy (and creative) to better engage with potential customers. However, be very cognizant that you are not perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes - which could lead to a PR disaster . Examples: “A rugged, strong truck for game day tailgates. You need this, dude.” “The perfect romance novel for when he falls asleep in his man cave.”;;;;;;;
;Facebook Canvas Ads;Facebook Canvas ads allow for a more immersive, media-rich experience in comparison to static advertisements. A major advantage of these ads is that they are opened inside Facebook as opposed to a mobile webpage creating a seamless experience with no load times. Functionality is also robust allowing for animations, product galleries, videos, and tilt-to-view images.;;;;;;;
;Smarter Process Ad Copy;Messaging that communicates the way your product improves a companies' process is a great ad-copy tactic (especially in the B2B space). Communicating that you CAN solve the problem is often a higher priority than HOW you will solve the problem.;;;;;;;
;Job Seniority Targeting;Similar to targeting job titles, targeting seniority can be an effective way of hitting the right people in your audience persona. Make sure you talk to your current (and best) customers to see what job title they hold to inspire your targeting choices here. You should be careful to test this rigorously and review the leads you get, as we've seen instances of people posting fake job titles, which dents the reliability of this type of targeting. The most accurate job title data we've seen is on LinkedIn.;;;;;;;
;Press Ad Copy;Take advantage of the press your offer generates by mentioning media outlets that have featured your product. Incorporating well-known media outlets or news sources can bolster your offer’s credibility while also acting as a guidepost for people to conduct additional research. Utilize earned media to it’s fullest extent... because, you earned it! Example: “New monitor featured on TechCrunch.” “In the New York Times last week.” “Recently featured on MTV.”;;;;;;;
;Value Proposition in Hero;Displaying product direct value propositions on the hero image is a great way to educate them on the value of the product.;;;;;;;
;Social Proof CTA;Using social proof as a part of your CTA adds legitimacy/authority, and people are more likely to follow a crowd. Find a strong and applicable quote about your product from a client or influencer and include it with a CTA button. This tactic can be effective for listbuilding, app installs, lead collection, etc;;;;;;;
;Infographic in Image Ad;Using an infographic in the image of your ad can drive performance. It’s a descriptive and visual way to depict what results your audience can expect when they buy into your product. Design a small, concise infographic for your ad and use it instead of your other images to see how it impacts your ad performance.;;;;;;;
;Two-Sided Referral;Try offering an incentive to users to refer you and for new users to join. This gives incentives to the person who shares (who benefits directly) and decreases anxiety for the person they share with (they also benefit, so they aren't worried about the person who shares getting an incentive).;;;;;;;
;Anchoring Ad Copy;"Leverage the anchoring effect in your copy by creating an “anchor” that helps people make decisions without hesitation. People have the tendency to rely too heavily on the information that is first presented to them; take advantage of this tendency. Connect your offer with a specific price-point or a more well-known brand to give potential customers a frame of reference. Examples: “5 blades, only 1 dollar.” “50% softer than Kleenex.” “Laptops that perform better than Apple products.”";;;;;;;
;Responsive Ad;In today's world, users are viewing advertisements on a wide array of displays. Utilize the responsive ad feature within Adwords for running on the Google Display Network (GDN). Your ad will change to the size needed for placement, allowing for better readability and more conversions.;;;;;;;
;Sponsored Reddit Post;Paying for sponsored text or link posts can drive engaged traffic from niche audiences within Subreddit communities (there are over 800,000 to choose from). This hyper-targeted approach can breed a great number of qualified leads. (Tip: make sure you have a solid understand of Reddiquette before posting.);;;;;;;
;Notify Featured Influencers;This is an obvious way to get more backlinks and social sharing, but most people get lazy and don't do it. Take advantage of the fact that you quote, reference, and feature different influencers in your content. Send them a quick email saying “Hey! We featured your quote/post/etc… in our blog! Check it out. Would love to hear your thoughts on the post.”;;;;;;;
;Viral Referral Widget;Add a widget to incentivize sharing post signup. If you’re already built a landing page that converts, take it a step further with a viral boost. Viral referral widgets allow you to offer rewards to users who share your website with friends in their network. Incentivizing people who sign up for your page to share it with their friends can quickly double your conversion rate without your company reaching out to anyone else.;;;;;;;
;Daily Social Posting;To increase brand awareness and acquire signups/users organically through engaging content through popular social media platforms.;;;;;;;
;Facebook Audience Narrow By Spending Method;Facebook allows you to target people who based on their credit card spending habits. Narrow your Facebook ad targeting to focus on this audience. For example, if you have a more expensive product or want to tap into an audience of high-volume shoppers, you can target high spenders. Narrow down further by other demographic and interest categories to get an even more targeted reach.;;;;;;;
;Short URLs;Using short URLs is a better user experience and there are indications that Google ranks shorter URLs higher than longer ones (all things being equal).;;;;;;;
;SumeMe Image Sharer;While many sites are utilizing tools that allow users to share text content, it is still rare for companies to include tools that allow users to share images. Image sharer solves this problem by allowing users to instantly share images on your site and link them back to you. Using Image sharer is an innovative and unique way to allow site visitors to engage with your content while also driving traffic to your site.;;;;;;;
;Target Audience Callout;Call out your target audience to catch their attention AND qualify leads. That a double win for CTR! This tactic is useful if your target audience shares a particular trait, profession, or identity. (Note: have a comprehensive understanding of your target audience before trying this tactic.) NOTE: For Facebook Ads, make sure your callout does not assert or imply anything about a person’s race, ethnic origin, religion, beliefs, age, sexual orientation or practices, gender identity, disability, medical condition (including physical or mental health), financial status, membership in a trade union, criminal record, or name. See policy for details .;;;;;;;
;Expat Audience;There are 92 million expatriates (aka expats) on Facebook. Engage with this substantial demographic using Facebook's robust targeting. Target expats living in certain countries or originating from a certain country.;;;;;;;
;Host Live Video;Use Periscope or Facebook live to broadcast what you're doing in the moment and get highly engaged users. These users will be more likely to interact with you through the broadcasting platforms and you’ll be able to build relationships with them directly.;;;;;;;
;Outbound Linking;Link out to relevant sites to prevent users who come to your site through search from returning to Google. Google considers a search more successful if after clicking on a search result, the user does not return to the search results page to select another link or create a new query. This is known as time to long click. Link out to valuable information sources so users leave your site on your terms rather than through Google, meaning an increase in long clicks and an increase in your search ranking.;;;;;;;
;Stock Image;Stock imagery can be a good neutral placeholder to test before you get hold of better proprietary pictures. Try to use images that look more natural and less posed, as these are likely to outperform photos that clearly look like stock photos. There are lots of stock photo sites out there with various prices from free to thousands of dollars per image.;;;;;;;
;Twitter Lead Ad (No Card);Try creating a lead ad without using Twitter's Lead Generation Cards, just using a link or photo instead. It feels less like an ad, so user will be less prone to skimming over it. Twitter lead cards are fancy and feature-rich, but they look like ads. Instead, try promoting a Tweet with an image and copy that you've found performed well in the past.;;;;;;;
;Referral Promotion;Referral programs can get lost in a site's architecture and potential customers may not be aware of an offer. By promoting a referral more people will be aware of it's existence and therefore more people will refer their friends. You can promote your referral program in many different ways: email newsletters, product update emails, milestone emails, in-app popups, directly on your landing page, in invoices/receipts, etc…;;;;;;;
;Free Trial Vs Demo Landing Page;Offering a free trial of your product can be a smoother entry and more enticing offer than scheduling a demo. Try offering a free trial, and guiding those users into a paid account.;;;;;;;
;Finality Ad Copy;Craft bold copy that exclaims the finality of your offer. People will no longer have to search for alternatives after finding your solution. Finished. Finito. Their problems will be alleviated and you will be the hero. Make your offer their final, indefinite solution. Examples: “The last razor you will ever have to buy.” “An ERP system to end all ERP systems.” “Stop searching for the perfect pen, we have the only pen you’ll ever need;;;;;;;
;Like Video CTA;Remind your watchers to like your video - just this one action can increase likes by 2-5x. This will help your video spread to other audiences and get more views.;;;;;;;
;Qualaroo Branching Surveys;You can create surveys with branching paths based on how users respond. If a user says they don't like parts of your product, you can ask them for deeper feedback. You can get clever with branching surveys - a user that shows great interest in your content, for example, can receive an email capture prompt to sign up for a newsletter based on their answers.;;;;;;;
; Appeal To Ego Sharing;When a person shares, they’ll want to know they did something great, not just for their friends, but for themselves. Appeal to their ego by making them look good to their friends. Use landing page copy for friends they referred to remind them who sent them to you. Send a message to both users when a referral turns into a conversion. They’ll both be much more likely to share in the future.;;;;;;;
;Rhyme As Reason Ad Copy;"As a marketer you have a solid understanding of why people are attracted to your offer. Spell out that reason by incorporating a playful rhyme. Put on your Dr. Seuss hat and rhyme your way to successful advertising. (Note: this can be difficult if your offer is oranges.) Example: “For that smooth shave you crave” “A new, energy efficient light for your delight.” “Visit a new shore that you are bound to adore.”
";;;;;;;
;Keyword Only URLs;Another SEO best practice for all blogs, instead of having random strings or the blog post title as your URL, use the keyword you’re trying to rank the blog post for as your URL slug. This both helps you have a clean URL that’s easy to understand for your readers, and whenever the link is copy-pasted, it acts as anchor text, which is great for retaining the SEO benefit of your link. Example: Instead of https://blog.ladder.io/144-actionable-growth-strategies-for-your-business/ We use https://blog.ladder.io/growth-strategies/;;;;;;;
;Long Video Description;"Google can't ""see"" what's in the video, so write a long description for them to analyze to convince them to rank you higher for the right keywords.";;;;;;;
;Guest Article Publishing;Be open to accepting guest articles from relevant authors for publishing on your blog. You can manually recruit these people by offering a quid-pro-quo (offer to write for their blog) or just as a way for them to increase their exposure. You get free content without having to write it yourself, and the credibility of the influencer who published on your site;;;;;;;
;Copy Best Adwords Ads For Meta Title / Description;Leverage your paid ads to test best versions and roll out on organic. You gather a lot of data from the performance of your ads - how well they do with your audience, how many leads they generate, etc… That data can be used to advance your SEO efforts, since you already know what works best from your ads.;;;;;;;
;Twitter App Re-Engagement Ad;Have users that have downloaded your app but dropped off the face of the earth? Chances are they liked what they saw but just forgot about your app. Re-engaging them with promoted app card ads that direct them straight back to your app is a great way to boost retention. Let users open your mobile app straight from a Tweet and watch as they flock right back to it;;;;;;;
;Keyword In Meta Titles;Adding the most important keyword you’re targeting into the meta titles of your page is a good way to increase organic search traffic. Prioritize the front end of your meta titles for the highest-importance keywords and make them relevant to the page content itself. Keep it short, simple, and easily readable by both individuals and search engines.;;;;;;;
;Find Keywords In Conference Agendas;"Search through conference agendas to find good ideas for keywords. Conference writers and speakers want their content to be seen beyond just the conference, especially in the aftermath, so they'll consciously or subconsciously use keywords that will help them rank on Google. These keywords will help you generate content ideas.
";;;;;;;
;CC Mentioned Influencers;When sharing a piece of content that mentions an influencer on social media, make sure you copy them into the post. They might share it with their audience, increasing the reach of your po;;;;;;;
;Top 10 List Placement;Create top 10 lists for products/startups in your industry and get each startup / product to push the content to their audience in return for being featured. This type of content is really easy to put together and can yield a high return on effort.;;;;;;;
;Casual Photo Ad;A casual photo - one that shows your product in action or in a natural setting without too much editing and staging - can be highly effective at increasing ad performance. This is because people seeing the ad get a view of your product in real-life, real-time use. You help them more effectively visualize what it will look like in their possession.;;;;;;;
;Blog Banners;Create a wide banner graphic for each blog post and/or post section.;;;;;;;
;Stickers & Wild Postings;In highly concentrated urban areas, many eye-balls can be captured with a simple, well positioned sticker or poster. These low cost tactics are used by rapidly growing startups, particularly those whose customers all congregate in a specific area (for example many developer tools use this method).;;;;;;;
;Delete Low Performing Blog Posts;If your blog post isn't getting much traffic and hasn't attracted many links, you should actually delete it as it could be harming your site's reputation.;;;;;;;
;Larger Font Size;Don't make your font size too small or people will bounce and that will hurt your rankings. This will help with time on site, which is a critical metric for better ranking on Google search.;;;;;;;
;Navigation Bar Keywords;Change around your landing page’s navigation bar to only feature relevant verticals based on search terms. This can be based on search terms used to get to your site and ones that users employ in your native search bar. Use your navigation bar to point to the most important pages on your site, such as your highest-selling product categories.;;;;;;;
;Right Side CTA Landing Page;Place your call to action form or button on the right side of your landing page to increase activation. Focusing on the right side of your landing page rather than the center, especially when the form remains visible while scrolling down the page, keeps registration forms and CTA buttons above the fold and easily accessible for visitors. This reduces friction between reading your marketing copy and signing up for a demo or free account.;;;;;;;
;Being Direct;Be direct with your landing page and CTA button copy. Rather than using flowery or roundabout language, get to the point quickly and authoritatively. This sends a clearer, stronger message to visitors that they should pay attention and sign up;;;;;;;
;Rankings Social Proof;When researching different products, services, restaurants, bars, or anything that involves a purchase decision, chances are you go to a recommendation site and look for the top provider in that category. Providing this information up front for your customers when you’re highly ranked in your industry can help you earn trust through social proof. Go for the most impressive of ranking lists to show visitors how great others think your products are.;;;;;;;
;Selling Benefits;Sell benefits instead of features. A benefit solves a higher order need and will convince a user to pay more. For example, you don't purchase a disposable camera because it's cheap, but rather because you want to capture memories without stressing about valuable equipment.;;;;;;;
;Video CTA;Add a link in an annotation in your YouTube videos to click back to your email list signup or other CTA. It’s a great way to capture emails of prospects who saw and enjoyed your videos. Include a link to a promotion or sale in a video annotation and consider referencing it in the video itself with a graphic. Use tracked Bitly links to track performance.;;;;;;;
;Lead Custom Audience;Retargeting leads on social media based on a custom audience can drive them back to your site to convert. You can use your current customer list to generate a custom audience that you can then target with ads. This can bring your current customers back to your site to view and buy new products.;;;;;;;
;Offer Free Consulting;Offer consulting for free along with a purchase of your product. It will let you get to know your target audience directly with face-to-face conversations, helps increase conversion, and will help you learn about what your audience needs and what challenges they face. Those learnings will help improve your product and marketing approach in the future.;;;;;;;
;Center CTA Landing Page;Putting a large call to action button in the center of your page can increase activation. The positioning will immediately draw attention to the CTA when someone lands on your page. Make sure the CTA stands out distinctly away from dense copy or complex images.;;;;;;;
;Influencer Testimonials;Try adding testimonials from industry influencers to your page. Reach out to influencers that use your product or that you have a close relationship with and ask them to give a brief testimonial. People who know and value the opinions of the influencer will come to see you as more trustworthy. This increases social proof and therefore conversion.;;;;;;;
;Video Testimonials  ;Adding a video testimonial can make your page look more professional and make it more engaging, increasing conversion rate. The content of the video is very important - take care not to make the testimonial look too staged or scripted. It should be as natural and honest as possible (even if that means the customer isn't being 100% deferential to your product).;;;;;;;
;Gated Content;Gating your content behind a contact information capture form, whether it’s an email field, a full blown contact info form, or a landing page, is a great way to collect the information you need from someone before you give them the information they want. You can give something away up front and hide the rest of the content or entirely gate the content.;;;;;;;
;Match CTA To Traffic 'Temperature';Different traffic sources have different levels of intent to buy. Retargeted customers are much more likely to buy, so a weak call to action or too much information can actually convince them otherwise - you should go strong with a more forceful call to action. On the flipside, if a prospect has never heard of you they would need a much more gentle introduction and a softer call to action is necessary.;;;;;;;
;Benefit Buttons  ;Instead of going with simple task-based button descriptions like ‘Register’, try going with something that highlights the benefit of signing up to visitors. For example, if you’re a productivity app, saying ‘Simplify my workflow’ rather than ‘Sign up’ can be more appealing and lead to higher conversion.;;;;;;;
;Updated Content Page  ;Sometimes you update content on a page that you've been using to drive conversions, but you aren't sure if the new content will perform as well as the old page did. The best practice is to A/B test new vs. old and see if there's a difference before switching it out fully. Split the percentage of visitors that land on each page and collect data over a few days to see which one works best.;;;;;;;
;Adding Urgency ;You might add urgency to your copy. Urgency is a word that gives some people pause: of course it reminds you of a cheap voice-over announcing “Quick! While supplies last!” With that said, that if used correctly, urgency is a highly effective marketing tactic. Using implied urgency, adding a time-sensitive incentive, or mentioning the quantity of product available are all examples of strategies that can cause a jump in conversion rate.;;;;;;;
;Quantity Social Proof;"Try listing the total number of people using your product to increase trust and therefore conversion. X many people can't be wrong! Try experimenting with a rolling number, a precise number or a number rounded up to the nearest hundred / thousand / million to see what converts best.
";;;;;;;
;Eccentric Subject Line;"Don't blend in, stand out! An eccentric subject line is catchy and draws attention, increasing the likelihood that readers will open your emails. i.e. ""Green with Envy: Avacado vs Pistachio"" ""What your dog knows better than you""";;;;;;;
;Email To App Deep Linking;"Most email links send users to the mobile web version for a website. Deep linked emails, on the other hand, link directly to content inside of a mobile app, if that mobile app is installed on a user's device. This provides a superior end user experience, as mobile apps are typically faster and better-optimized than mobile websites. It also gives users the full featureset of a dedicated mobile app over the limited features of a responsive mobile site.

";;;;;;;
;Deep Linked Advertising;Take users to the exact app content that is featured in an ad. Use deep links with your ads to make the user's journey from seeing your ad to clicking on it and arriving at a product page destination seamless. You can use this tactic with any ad platform, from search to social. The ad's landing page is as important as its copy, so getting users to the right page will help increase conversions.;;;;;;;
;Discount Popup Copy;Test discount popup copy to see what level of discount is needed to draw your potential customers from consideration to purchase. You can try percentage-off, free shipping, BOGO, or any other discount approach.;;;;;;;
;"Gazing Social Proof
";Try putting an image or photo of a person looking at the call to action on your site. It's a nice psychological trick to improve trust and draw attention to the CTA. It directs an arrow of vision directly at the part of your site you want a visitor to see.;;;;;;;
;Less Choice;Give a visitor less choice, instead of too many options. Too much choice can limit conversions: The more options you give a potential customer, the harder their decision-making process becomes. Barry Schwartz’s famous Ted Talk on the Paradox of Choice gives a great overview of how too much choice can lead to over-analysis and buyer’s remorse. There is an argument to be made that giving the customer a lot of choice can be freeing for them, but as with all solutions, the best approach is probably to rigorously test each hypothesis.;;;;;;;
;Checkout Lock in;Lock the customer in the checkout so the only thing to do is finishing the process. Remove Navbar etc.;;;;;;;
;One Page Checkout ;Create a one page Checkout page, minimising the steps to conversion;;;;;;;
;"Swipe File Call To Action
";Offer a swipe file of best practice designs as your call to action.;;;;;;;
;Daily Deal Promotion;Send your product out in a daily deal promotion on sites like AppSumo and offer a discount to members. This can drive thousands of relevant customers from app promotion sites that have a wide distribution.;;;;;;;
;Useful Calculations;Try useful calculations instead of asking to do math. Most people aren't able or willing to do basic calculations, so spelling it out for them can improve conversion. For example telling them how quickly they'll run out of credit, how long ago a post was posted (rather than just a timestamp) and how much they'll save from a discount (rather than a %).;;;;;;;
;Blog Purpose On Homepage;"Putting the purpose or theme of your blog explicitly in the hero copy on the homepage will set the expectations of your readers and draw them in to the content.
";;;;;;;
;Video Email Capture;You can capture an email address at the midpoint of a video. Video Email Capture, also known as “Gating,” is a creative solution to make your videos interactive and generate leads. Basically, it makes watching, or continuing to watch, your video dependent on the user entering their email address. This generates very high-quality leads, as you’re getting an email address from people who have already proven themselves willing to commit to engaging with your content. Brightcove has a great explanation of how it works, and Wistia makes a great tool to implement it.;;;;;;;
;Free Premium Trial;If you have a freemium product, offering a free month trial of your premium offering is a great way to show your users what they’re missing out on. Without this trial, you can only rely on landing page copy and ads to do that work. Let your users experience your premium product instead - once the trial ends, they’ll see how much they got out of your premium features and will be more likely to convert.;;;;;;;
;Pinterest Style Blog;Use a blog template that looks similar to Pinterest. This format can work well for blogs that intend to be image heavy, such as fashion or food blogs, but can work across industries if there's lots of high quality custom imagery.;;;;;;;
;"""Snappy"" Subject Line";"Stay short & sweet, and human. Grab people’s interest and get them straight into your email. i.e. ""TGIF!"" ""Need a hand?""";;;;;;;
;Sincere Subject Line;"Sincerity in an email subject line can activate users and customers that have been loyal or have dropped off your service. i.e. ""We can't thank you enough"", ""You're what makes us great"", ""Because we've missed you. Enjoy 15% off""";;;;;;;
;Last Day Of Offer Email;Be sure to send an email on the last day of an offer. People respond differently to a situation when urgency is introduced: we suspend normal thought patterns and react to the urgent need. A reminder that the offer they have the opportunity to take is expiring creates a scenario where they are forced to make a decision immediately..;;;;;;;
;Web To App Deep Linking;You can use banners, interstitials, and links to send mobile web traffic directly to your mobile app. Try setting up links in your mobile site that deep link to the specific pages and products people want in your app. You can also create a full user journey from end to end that involves an app install. The biggest advantage here is that on mobile apps, users tend to convert and spend at a higher rate.;;;;;;;
;Profile Email Link;Post a link to your email list signup form on all of your social profiles. You should make sure you're covering Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and even Skype. If you think about all the people you interact with every day who are seeing your profile, you can quickly get a good idea of how many passive signups you'll be getting just by adding a simple link.;;;;;;;
;"""Best Of"" Roundup Page";A page getting directly to the point with a roundup of your all time best products can drive an increase in conversion rate. Those products already perform well with your target audience and promoting them clearly is a great way to draw more attention to them and increase sales. Select your top 5 or 10 best-selling or most demanded products and list them prominently on your landing page to get the attention of interested visitors.;;;;;;;
;Video Description CTA;"Add a link in the description in your YouTube videos to click back to your email list signup or other CTA. It’s a great way to capture emails of prospects who saw and enjoyed your videos. Include a link to a promotion or sale in your video’s description and consider referencing it in the video itself with a graphic. Use tracked Bitly links to track performance.
";;;;;;;
;Pen & Paper Email List;At an event or in-store, have a pen and paper list and ask directly for people to sign up and fill out their email. It’s an effective low-tech way to get new sign-ups for your email list. It drives you to actively seek people out and make a face-to-face case for signing up.;;;;;;;
;Smaller Commitments;Smaller CommitmentsThink about how you’re getting your opt-ins. Using a series of smaller commitments, instead of one large one, can be more efficacious, as it plays into a user’s sense of self-identity. For example, you could try asking small questions, like the old sales technique of getting a customer to start saying yes. Instead of just asking for a user’s email address right away, ask if they’re interested in looking around, then follow that with a prompt to see more content, then follow that with a request for their email;;;;;;;
