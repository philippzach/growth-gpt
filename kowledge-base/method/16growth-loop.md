# Growth Loops

How does your product grow?

This seemslike a simple question. But what everyone inevitably finds is one or more things:

Everyone has a different answer
The answer represents only one piece of the puzzle
The answer talks about the output of $$$, but not the inputs of usage
This is a BIG problem. If everyone has a different or incomplete picture of how the product grows, then you can't have apples-to-apples discussions about priorities, metrics, goals, or strategy. This leads to a few things:

People focused on different things
The teams moving in opposite directions
People not on the same page with CEO/exec team/others as to what is most important
“How does your product grow?” is simply the most important question to be able to answer. Growing is the entire reason why products and companies exist (especially in venture-backed startups). Companies that continually grow also provide the largest positive outcomes. More importantly, personally in your career if you drive growth at your company, you are rewarded vs others who do not drive growth.

So, what is the best way to answer this question?

Using Growth Loops

"Compound interest is man's greatest invention." – Einstein

The fastest-growing products are better represented as a system of loops, not funnels. Loops are closed systems where the inputs through some process generates more of an output that can be reinvested in the input. There are growth loops that serve different value creation including new users, returning users, defensibility, or efficiency.

## What is a Growth Loop

A growth loop is a self-sustaining, iterative process designed to drive continuous growth and improvement in a marketing strategy. It involves identifying key performance indicators (KPIs), setting goals, implementing tactics, measuring results, and refining the approach based on data-driven insights.

By constantly analysing and optimising each element within the loop, marketers can create a virtuous cycle of growth that fuels itself through increased customer acquisition, engagement, and retention. This holistic approach to marketing enables businesses to scale effectively, maximise return on investment (ROI), and stay ahead of the competition.

## Growth Loop Overview

1. (Input) New User - A new or returning user is created by reinvesting the output of the loop
2. Action/Step - A series of actions/steps that generate the output
3. Output - The steps produce some output that can be directly reinvested in the input

### Examples

#### Pinterest

1. New/Returning User - Free content found in search engines drives users to sign up or return to Pinterest
2. Activate with Content - Pinterest activates you with specific, relevant content
3. Save New or Repin - Users save new content or repin existing content, which drives quality signals.
4. Search Engine Index - Pinterest packages the content for search engines using quality signals

#### Survey Monkey

1. New/Returning user - User who has taken a SurveyMonkey survey and branding signs up
2. Create Survey - Users create surveys.
3. Send Survey - Survey creators distribute surveys to collect responses
4. See SM End Page - Those that finish surveys see SurveyMonkey branding and landing page.

## How does a growth loop work?

A growth loop works by creating a self-sustaining cycle of user acquisition, engagement, and retention that drives continuous growth for a business. This process begins with attracting new users through targeted marketing efforts, such as content marketing, social media, or paid advertising. Once users are acquired, the focus shifts to engaging and retaining them through personalized experiences, valuable content, and seamless user interfaces. As users become more engaged and satisfied, they are more likely to refer others to the product or service, creating a viral effect that brings in new users. This cycle of acquisition, engagement, and referral continues to fuel growth, allowing marketers to scale their efforts and achieve long-term success.

## Questions to ask yourself

As a modern growth marketing or agile marketing professional, ask yourself the following questions with regard to a growth loop:

What are the key actions or behaviors that drive user acquisition, engagement, and retention in the growth loop?

How can I optimise each stage of the growth loop to improve the overall performance and efficiency of the loop?

What are the primary channels and tactics that can be leveraged to fuel the growth loop and reach the target audience?

How can I measure the success and impact of the growth loop, and what key performance indicators (KPIs) should be tracked to ensure continuous improvement?

What potential roadblocks or challenges might hinder the effectiveness of the growth loop, and how can they be addressed or mitigated?

## Import things to remember

Treat each part of the loop as it’s own step. Allowing you to focus on one step, and seeing how you can optimize the conversion rate of it. Much like the pirate funnel. This will help strengthen the loop. The closer a growth loop is to your core business actions, the higher the impact. Remember, you can have several growth loops.
An output typically falls within one or more of these three categories; Quality Signal, Collaboration and Content
To track a growth loop, and user behavior we recommend a tool such as Amplitude or Mixpanel.

## Checklist

Does your output create more output in the next cycle?
Does your output have a “broadcasting effect” of more than 1 person?
Note: an output that can be repeated (done more than once) and is only broadcasted to 1 person does still achieve a broadcasting effect.
