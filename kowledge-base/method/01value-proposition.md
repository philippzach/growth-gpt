After finishing this you should have a USP (unique value proposition) that differentiates you from your competitors and you can use to market your product to the right audience.

Your unique factor directly relates to the type of clients you will land and who your customers are
What makes you - you
How would you act with no social pressure around you?

## Finding your Voice

Ask yourself:

What angers you?
What makes you cry?
What have you mastered?
What gives you hope?
As a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?
If you had all the time and money in the world, what would you do?
What would blow your mind?
What platform do you own?
What change would you like to see in the world?
If you had one day left, how would you spend it?

## Differentiate Yourself

It’s your job to assist them by making your unique selling proposition obvious, different and memorable enough that they can see exactly what your business has to offer that possible competitors do not.

It does not have to be about the product or service. It can be purely the vision.

## Purpose Driven Entrepreneurs

Who are you helping?

Charities?
Young organizations?
Building schools?
Building communities?
Inspiring the leaders of tomorrow?

## Don’t Spend Your Time Convincing People

You’re not trying to convince people

You’re to live by example

Put this lifestyle into your unique selling proposition
